	abstract = {Reports of environmental and human health impacts of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have greatly increased in the peer-reviewed literature. The goals of the present review are to assess the state of the science regarding toxicological effects of PFAS and to develop strategies for advancing knowledge on the health effects of this large family of chemicals. Currently, much of the toxicity data available for PFAS are for a handful of chemicals, primarily legacy PFAS such as perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate. Epidemiological studies have revealed associations between exposure to specific PFAS and a variety of health effects, including altered immune and thyroid function, liver disease, lipid and insulin dysregulation, kidney disease, adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes, and cancer. Concordance with experimental animal data exists for many of these effects. However, information on modes of action and adverse outcome pathways must be expanded, and profound differences in PFAS toxicokinetic properties must be considered in understanding differences in responses between the sexes and among species and life stages. With many health effects noted for a relatively few example compounds and hundreds of other PFAS in commerce lacking toxicity data, more contemporary and high-throughput approaches such as read-across, molecular dynamics, and protein modeling are proposed to accelerate the development of toxicity information on emerging and legacy PFAS, individually and as mixtures. In addition, an appropriate degree of precaution, given what is already known from the PFAS examples noted, may be needed to protect human health.

	abstract = {During the past fifteen years commercial interest in compounds containing carbon­ fluorine bonds has burgeoned beyond all expectations, mainly owing to business opportunities arising from work on biologically active fluoroorganics-particularly agrochemicals, the relentless search for new markets for fluoropolymers and fluoro­ carbon fluids, developments in the field of medical diagnostics, and the drive to find replacements for ozone-depleting CFCs and Halon fire-extinguishing agents. Judging the situation to warrant the publication of a comprehensive collection of up-to-date reviews dealing with commercial organofluorine compounds within a single volume of manageable size (and hence reasonable cost), we were delighted to be invited by Plenum Publishing Corporation to produce a suitable book. In order to provide an authentic and wide-ranging account of current commercial applications of fluoroorganic materials, it clearly was necessary to assemble a sizeable team of knowledgeable contributing authors selected almost entirely from industry. Through their efforts we have been able to produce an almost complete coverage of the modem organofluorochemicals business in a manner designed to attract a reader­ ship ranging from experts in the field, through chemists and technologists currently unaware of the extent of industrial involvement with fluoroorganics, to students of applied chemistry. Promised chapters dedicated to perfluoroolefin oxides and 18F labeling of radiopharmaceuticals failed to materialize. This is somewhat unfortunate in view of our aim to achieve comprehensive coverage of the subject.},

	abstract = {The primary aim of this article is to provide an overview of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) detected in the environment, wildlife, and humans, and recommend clear, specific, and descriptive terminology, names, and acronyms for PFASs. The overarching objective is to unify and harmonize communication on PFASs by offering terminology for use by the global scientific, regulatory, and industrial communities. A particular emphasis is placed on long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids, substances related to the long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids, and substances intended as alternatives to the use of the long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids or their precursors. First, we define PFASs, classify them into various families, and recommend a pragmatic set of common names and acronyms for both the families and their individual members. Terminology related to fluorinated polymers is an important aspect of our classification. Second, we provide a brief description of the 2 main production processes, electrochemical fluorination and telomerization, used for introducing perfluoroalkyl moieties into organic compounds, and we specify the types of byproducts (isomers and homologues) likely to arise in these processes. Third, we show how the principal families of PFASs are interrelated as industrial, environmental, or metabolic precursors or transformation products of one another. We pay particular attention to those PFASs that have the potential to be converted, by abiotic or biotic environmental processes or by human metabolism, into long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic or sulfonic acids, which are currently the focus of regulatory action. The Supplemental Data lists 42 families and subfamilies of PFASs and 268 selected individual compounds, providing recommended names and acronyms, and structural formulas, as well as Chemical Abstracts Service registry numbers.

	abstract = {Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) encompass a large, heterogenous group of chemicals of potential concern to human health and the environment. Based on information for a few relatively well-understood PFAS such as perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoate, there is ample basis to suspect that at least a subset can be considered persistent, bioaccumulative, and/or toxic. However, data suitable for determining risks in either prospective or retrospective assessments are lacking for the majority of PFAS. In August 2019, the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry sponsored a workshop that focused on the state-of-the-science supporting risk assessment of PFAS. The present review summarizes discussions concerning the ecotoxicology and ecological risks of PFAS. First, we summarize currently available information relevant to problem formulation/prioritization, exposure, and hazard/effects of PFAS in the context of regulatory and ecological risk assessment activities from around the world. We then describe critical gaps and uncertainties relative to ecological risk assessments for PFAS and propose approaches to address these needs. Recommendations include the development of more comprehensive monitoring programs to support exposure assessment, an emphasis on research to support the formulation of predictive models for bioaccumulation, and the development of in silico, in vitro, and in vivo methods to efficiently assess biological effects for potentially sensitive species/endpoints. Addressing needs associated with assessing the ecological risk of PFAS will require cross-disciplinary approaches that employ both conventional and new methods in an integrated, resource-effective manner.

Despite this high diversity, all PFAS are alike in that they contain perfluoroalkyl moieties that are extremely resistant to environmental and metabolic degradation. The vast majority of PFAS are therefore either non-degradable or transform ultimately into stable terminal transformation products (which are still PFAS). Under the European chemicals regulation this classifies PFAS as very persistent substances (vP). We argue that this high persistence is sufficient concern for their management as a chemical class, and for all "non-essential" uses of PFAS to be phased out. The continual release of highly persistent PFAS will result in increasing concentrations and increasing probabilities of the occurrence of known and unknown effects. Once adverse effects are identified, the exposure and associated effects will not be easily reversible. Reversing PFAS contamination will be technically challenging, energy intensive, and costly for society, as is evident in the efforts to remove PFAS from contaminated land and drinking water sources.},

	abstract = {Grouping strategies are needed for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), in part, because it would be time and resource intensive to test and evaluate the more than 4700 PFAS on the global market on a chemical-by-chemical basis. In this paper we review various grouping strategies that could be used to inform actions on these chemicals and outline the motivations, advantages and disadvantages for each. Grouping strategies are subdivided into (1) those based on the intrinsic properties of the PFAS (e.g. persistence, bioaccumulation potential, toxicity, mobility, molecular size) and (2) those that inform risk assessment through estimation of cumulative exposure and/or effects. The most precautionary grouping approach of those reviewed within this article suggests phasing out PFAS based on their high persistence alone (the so-called "P-sufficient" approach). The least precautionary grouping approach reviewed advocates only grouping PFAS for risk assessment that have the same toxicological effects, modes and mechanisms of action, and elimination kinetics, which would need to be well documented across different PFAS. It is recognised that, given jurisdictional differences in chemical assessment philosophies and methodologies, no one strategy will be generally acceptable. The guiding question we apply to the reviewed grouping strategies is: grouping for what purpose? The motivation behind the grouping (e.g. determining use in products vs. setting guideline levels for contaminated environments) may lead to different grouping decisions. This assessment provides the necessary context for grouping strategies such that they can be adopted as they are, or built on further, to protect human and environmental health from potential PFAS-related effects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of manmade chemicals containing at least one fully fluorinated carbon atom. The widespread use, large number, and diverse chemical structures of PFAS pose challenges to any sufficiently protective regulation, emissions reduction, and remediation at contaminated sites. Regulating only a subset of PFAS has led to their replacement with other members of the class with similar hazards, that is, regrettable substitutions. Regulations that focus solely on perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are ineffective, given that nearly all other PFAS can generate PFAAs in the environment.
OBJECTIVES: In this commentary, we present the rationale adopted by the State of California's Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) for regulating PFAS as a class in certain consumer products.
DISCUSSION: We at the California DTSC propose regulating certain consumer products if they contain any member of the class of PFAS because: a) all PFAS, or their degradation, reaction, or metabolism products, display at least one common hazard trait according to the California Code of Regulations, namely environmental persistence; and b) certain key PFAS that are the degradation, reaction or metabolism products, or impurities of nearly all other PFAS display additional hazard traits, including toxicity; are widespread in the environment, humans, and biota; and will continue to cause adverse impacts for as long as any PFAS continue to be used. Regulating PFAS as a class is thus logical, necessary, and forward-thinking. This technical position may be helpful to other regulatory agencies in comprehensively addressing this large class of chemicals with common hazard traits. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7431.},

Phase-out actions and use restrictions to reduce the environmental release of long-chain PFCAs, PFSAs and their precursors have been taken since 2000. In particular, long-chain poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are being replaced with shorter-chain homologues or other fluorinated or non-fluorinated alternatives. A key question is: are these alternatives, particularly the structurally similar fluorinated alternatives, less hazardous to humans and the environment than the substances they replace? Several fluorinated alternatives including perfluoroether carboxylic acids (PFECAs) and perfluoroether sulfonic acids (PFESAs) have been recently identified. However, the scarcity of experimental data prevents hazard and risk assessments for these substances. In this study, we use state-of-the-art in silico tools to estimate key properties of these newly identified fluorinated alternatives. [i] COSMOtherm and SPARC are used to estimate physicochemical properties. The US EPA EPISuite software package is used to predict degradation half-lives in air, water and soil. [ii] In combination with estimated chemical properties, a fugacity-based multimedia mass-balance unit-world model – the OECD Overall Persistence (POV) and Long-Range Transport Potential (LRTP) Screening Tool – is used to assess the likely environmental fate of these alternatives. Even though the fluorinated alternatives contain some structural differences, their physicochemical properties are not significantly different from those of their predecessors. Furthermore, most of the alternatives are estimated to be similarly persistent and mobile in the environment as the long-chain PFASs. The models therefore predict that the fluorinated alternatives will become globally distributed in the environment similar to their predecessors. Although such in silico methods are coupled with uncertainties, this preliminary assessment provides enough cause for concern to warrant experimental work to better determine the properties of these fluorinated alternatives.},

A dynamic one-compartment toxicokinetic (TK) model for male rats was constructed and evaluated using test data from toxicity studies for perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluoroctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and ammonium 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy)-propanoate (GenX). Dose-response curves of liver enlargement from sub-chronic oral toxicity studies in male rats were converted to internal dose in serum and in liver to examine the toxicity ranking of PFAAs and fluorinated alternatives. Converting administered doses into equivalent serum and liver concentrations reduced the variability in the dose-response curves for PFBA, PFHxA, PFOA and GenX. The toxicity ranking using modeled serum (GenX {\textgreater} PFOA {\textgreater} PFHxA {\textgreater} PFBA) and liver (GenX {\textgreater} PFOA ≈ PFHxA ≈ PFBA) concentrations indicated that some fluorinated alternatives have similar or higher toxic potency than their predecessors when correcting for differences in toxicokinetics. For PFOS and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) the conversion from administered dose to serum concentration equivalents did not change the toxicity ranking. In conclusion, hazard assessment based on internal exposure allows evaluation of toxic potency and bioaccumulation potential independent of kinetics and should be considered when comparing fluorinated alternatives with their predecessors.},

Thus, in vitro assays using neural cell cultures are being developed for key neurodevelopmental events, including proliferation, neural differentiation, migration, synaptogenesis, and neurite outgrowth. The advent of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons provides a novel model system. Human iPSC-derived neurons demonstrate the morphology and physiology of their in situ counterparts and have been commercialized and made available in large numbers, facilitating their use in chemical testing. The present study evaluated the neuronal characteristics of commercially available, cryopreserved human iPSC-derived neurons (iCell® neurons). Immunocytochemistry revealed a relatively pure population of neurons that extended both putative axons and dendrites. The cells developed neurites rapidly and consistently as quantified using automated HCI. Exposure to a training set of eight chemicals previously demonstrated to affect neurite outgrowth in rodent and/or human neurons resulted in concentration-dependent decreases in neurite outgrowth in human iCell neurons, although the response to chemicals was different from the response observed in rat cortical neurons. Lead and U0126 had no effect in rat cortical neurons but decreased neurite outgrowth in human neurons. In contrast, etoposide decreased both neurite outgrowth and viability in rat primary cortical cultures, but was much less potent in human iPSC-derived neurons. Together, these data demonstrate that commercially available human iPSC-derived neurons are amenable for use in medium- to high-throughput assays of neurite outgrowth using HCI. Though limited, the data indicate that human and rodent neurons can respond differently to chemical insult, and suggest that in vitro toxicity testing should include the use of human-derived cells.},

	abstract = {Medium- to high-throughput in vitro assays that recapitulate the critical processes of nervous system development have been proposed as a means to facilitate rapid testing and identification of chemicals which may affect brain development. In vivo neurodevelopment is a complex progression of distinct cellular processes. Therefore, batteries of in vitro assays that model and quantify effects on a variety of neurodevelopmental processes have the potential to identify chemicals which may affect brain development at different developmental stages. In the present study, the results of concentration-response screening of 67 reference chemicals in a battery of high content imaging and microplate reader-based assays that evaluate neural progenitor cell proliferation, neural proginitor cell apoptosis, neurite initiation/outgrowth, neurite maturation and synaptogenesis are summarized and compared. The assay battery had a high degree of combined sensitivity (87\%) for categorizing chemicals known to affect neurodevelopment as active and a moderate degree of combined specificity (71\%) for categorizing chemicals not associated with affects on neurodevelopment as inactive. The combined sensitivity of the assay battery was higher compared to any individual assay while the combined specificity of the assay battery was lower compared to any individual assay. When selectivity of effects for a neurodevelopmental endpoint as compared to general cytotoxicity was taken into account, the combined sensitivity of the assay battery decreased (68\%) while the combined specificity increased (93\%). The identity and potency of chemicals identified as active varied across the assay battery, underscoring the need for use of a combination of diverse in vitro models to comprehensively screen chemicals and identify those which potentially affect neurodevelopment. Overall, these data indicate that a battery of assays which address many different processes in nervous system development may be used to identify potential developmental neurotoxicants and to distinguish specific from generalized cytotoxic effects with a high degree of success.},

	abstract = {Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and related compounds are per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) of concern from toxicological, environmental, and regulatory perspectives. In 2019, the Conference of the Parties to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants listed PFOA, its salts, and PFOA-related compounds in Annex A to the Convention. Additionally, the listing specifically included PFOA branched isomers and compounds containing a perfluoroheptyl (C7F15)C moiety, with some noted exclusions. A draft updated “Indicative List” of 393 PFASs (335 with defined structures), each specified as falling within or outside the listing, was released for comment in 2021. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s CompTox Chemicals Dashboard has published a curated PFAS list containing more than 10,700 structures. Applying the PFOA and related compounds listing definition to screen this list required a structure-based approach capable of discerning salts and branched or linear forms of the (C7F15)C moiety. A PFOA SMILES workflow and associated Excel macro file, developed to address this need, applies a series of text substitution rules to a set of canonicalized SMILES structure representations to convert branched forms of the (C7F15)C moiety to linear forms to aid their detection. The approach correctly classified each Stockholm Convention draft Indicative List structure relative to the PFOA and related compounds definition, and accurately discerned branched and linear forms of the (C7F15)C moiety in over 10,700 PFAS structures with 100\% sensitivity (no false negatives) and 99.7\% accuracy (35 false positives). Approximately 20\% of structures in the large PFAS list fell within the PFOA and related compounds definition, and 10\% of those were branched. The present work highlights the need to computationally detect branched forms of PFASs and promotes the use of unambiguous, structure-based definitions, along with tools that are publicly available and easy to use, to support clear communication and regulatory action within the PFAS community.},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of man-made chemicals of global concern for many health and regulatory agencies due to their widespread use and persistence in the environment (in soil, air, and water), bioaccumulation, and toxicity. This concern has catalyzed a need to aggregate data to support research efforts that can, in turn, inform regulatory and statutory actions. An ongoing challenge regarding PFAS has been the shifting definition of what qualifies a substance to be a member of the PFAS class. There is no single definition for a PFAS, but various attempts have been made to utilize substructural definitions that either encompass broad working scopes or satisfy narrower regulatory guidelines. Depending on the size and specificity of PFAS substructural filters applied to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) DSSTox database, currently exceeding 900,000 unique substances, PFAS substructure-defined space can span hundreds to tens of thousands of compounds. This manuscript reports on the curation of PFAS chemicals and assembly of lists that have been made publicly available to the community via the EPA’s CompTox Chemicals Dashboard. Creation of these PFAS lists required the harvesting of data from EPA and online databases, peer-reviewed publications, and regulatory documents. These data have been extracted and manually curated, annotated with structures, and made available to the community in the form of lists defined by structure filters, as well as lists comprising non-structurable PFAS, such as polymers and complex mixtures. These lists, along with their associated linkages to predicted and measured data, are fueling PFAS research efforts within the EPA and are serving as a valuable resource to the international scientific community.},

The ability to assess the impact of existing chemicals for which little to no toxicity data are available or to foresee such effects during early stages of chemical development and use, and before potential exposure occurs, is a pressing need. However, the capacity of the current toxicity evaluation approaches to meet this demand is limited by low throughput and high costs. In the context of EPA's ToxCast project, we have evaluated a novel cellular biosensor system (Factorial (1) ) that enables rapid, high-content assessment of a compound's impact on gene regulatory networks. The Factorial biosensors combined libraries of cis- and trans-regulated transcription factor reporter constructs with a highly homogeneous method of detection enabling simultaneous evaluation of multiplexed transcription factor activities. Here, we demonstrate the application of the technology toward determining bioactivity profiles by quantitatively evaluating the effects of 309 environmental chemicals on 25 nuclear receptors and 48 transcription factor response elements. We demonstrate coherent transcription factor activity across nuclear receptors and their response elements and that Nrf2 activity, a marker of oxidative stress, is highly correlated to the overall promiscuity of a chemical. Additionally, as part of the ToxCast program, we identify molecular targets that associate with in vivo end points and represent modes of action that can serve as potential toxicity pathway biomarkers and inputs for predictive modeling of in vivo toxicity.},

To inform methods for prioritizing these data-poor chemicals for detailed toxicity studies, we evaluated 142 PFAS using an in vitro screening platform consisting of two multiplexed transactivation assays encompassing 81 diverse transcription factor activities and tested in concentration-response format ranging from 137 nM to 300 μM. Results showed activity for various nuclear receptors, including three known PFAS targets--specifically estrogen receptor alpha and peroxisome proliferator receptors alpha and gamma. We also report activity against the retinoid X receptor beta, the key heterodimeric partner of type II, non-steroidal nuclear receptors. Additional activities were found against the pregnane X receptor, nuclear receptor related-1 protein, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, a sensor of oxidative stress. Using orthogonal assay approaches, we confirmed activity of representative PFAS against several of these targets. Finally, we identified key PFAS structural features associated with nuclear receptor activity that can inform future predictive models for use in prioritizing chemicals for risk assessment and in the design of new structures devoid of biological activity.},

A few PFASs have comparatively extensive amounts of human epidemiological, exposure, and experimental animal toxicity data (e.g., perfluorooctanoic acid), whereas little toxicity and exposure information exists for much of the broader set of PFASs. Given that traditional approaches to generate toxicity information are resource intensive, new approach methods, including in vitro high-throughput toxicity (HTT) testing, are being employed to inform PFAS hazard characterization and further (in vivo) testing.

This article describes the construction of a PFAS screening library and the process by which a targeted subset of 75 PFASs were selected. Multiple factors were considered, including interest to the U.S. EPA, compounds within targeted categories, structural diversity, exposure considerations, procurability and testability, and availability of existing toxicity data.

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a large and diverse class of chemicals of great interest due to their wide commercial applicability, as well as increasing public concern regarding their adverse impacts. A common terminology for PFASs was recommended in 2011, including broad categorization and detailed naming for many PFASs with rather simple molecular structures. Recent advancements in chemical analysis have enabled identification of a wide variety of PFASs that are not covered by this common terminology. The resulting inconsistency in categorizing and naming of PFASs is preventing efficient assimilation of reported information. This article explores how a combination of expert knowledge and cheminformatics approaches could help address this challenge in a systematic manner. First, the "splitPFAS" approach was developed to systematically subdivide PFASs (for eventual categorization) following a CnF2n+1-X-R pattern into their various parts, with a particular focus on 4 PFAS categories where X is CO, SO2, CH2 and CH2CH2. Then, the open, ontology-based "ClassyFire" approach was tested for potential applicability to categorizing and naming PFASs using five scenarios of original and simplified structures based on the "splitPFAS" output. This workflow was applied to a set of 770 PFASs from the latest OECD PFAS list. While splitPFAS categorized PFASs as intended, the ClassyFire results were mixed. These results reveal that open cheminformatics approaches have the potential to assist in categorizing PFASs in a consistent manner, while much development is needed for future systematic naming of PFASs. The "splitPFAS" tool and related code are publicly available, and include options to extend this proof-of-concept to encompass further PFASs in the future.},

To address this issue, methods to screen compounds rapidly for DNT hazard evaluation are necessary and are being developed for key neurodevelopmental processes. In order to develop an assay for network formation, this study evaluated effects of a training set of chemicals on network ontogeny by measuring spontaneous electrical activity in neural networks grown on microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Rat (0-24 h old) primary cortical cells were plated in 48 well-MEA plates and exposed to 6 compounds: acetaminophen, bisindolylmaleimide-1 (Bis-1), domoic acid, mevastatin, sodium orthovanadate, and loperamide for a period of 12 days. Spontaneous network activity was recorded on days 2, 5, 7, 9, and 12 and viability was assessed using the Cell Titer Blue assay on day 12. Network activity (e.g. mean firing rate [MFR], burst rate [BR], etc), increased between days 5 and 12. Random Forest analysis indicated that across all compounds and times, temporal correlation of firing patterns (r), MFR, BR, number of active electrodes and \% of spikes in a burst were the most influential parameters in separating control from treated wells. All compounds except acetaminophen (≤ 30 µM) caused concentration-related effects on one or more of these parameters. Domoic acid and sodium orthovanadate altered several of these parameters in the absence of cytotoxicity. Although cytotoxicity was observed with Bis1, mevastatin, and loperamide, some parameters were affected by these compounds at concentrations below those resulting in cytotoxicity. These results demonstrate that this assay may be suitable for screening of compounds for DNT hazard identification.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Unexpected drug activities account for many of the failures of new chemical entities in clinical trials. These activities can be target-dependent, resulting from feedback mechanisms downstream of the primary target, or they can occur as a result of unanticipated secondary target(s). Methods that would provide rapid and efficient characterization of compounds with respect to a broad range of biological pathways and mechanisms relevant to human disease have the potential to improve preclinical and clinical success rates.
METHODS: BioMAP assays containing primary human cells (endothelial cells and co-cultures with peripheral blood leukocytes) were stimulated in complex formats (specific combinations of inflammatory mediators) for 24 h in the presence or absence of test agents (drugs, experimental compounds, etc.). The levels of selected protein readouts (adhesion receptors, cytokines, enzymes, etc.) were measured and activity profiles (normalized data sets comprising BioMAP profiles) were generated for each test agent. The resulting profiles were compared by statistical methods to identify similarities and mechanistic insights.
RESULTS: Compounds with known mechanisms including inhibitors of histamine H1 receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme, IkappaB kinase-2, beta2 adrenergic receptor and others were shown to generate reproducible and distinguishable BioMAP activity profiles. Similarities were observed between compounds targeting components within the same signal transduction pathway (e.g. NFkappaB), and also between compounds that share secondary targets (e.g. ibuprofen and FMOC-L-leucine, a PPARgamma agonist).
DISCUSSION: Complex primary cell-based assays can be applied for detecting and distinguishing unexpected activities that may be of relevance to drug action in vivo. The ability to rapidly test compounds prior to animal or clinical studies may reduce the number of compounds that unexpectedly fail in preclinical or clinical studies.},

	abstract = {Many chemicals in commerce today have undergone limited or no safety testing. To reduce the number of untested chemicals and prioritize limited testing resources, several governmental programs are using high-throughput in vitro screens for assessing chemical effects across multiple cellular pathways. In this study, metabolic clearance and plasma protein binding were experimentally measured for 35 ToxCast phase I chemicals. The experimental data were used to parameterize a population-based in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation model for estimating the human oral equivalent dose necessary to produce a steady-state in vivo concentration equivalent to in vitro AC(50) (concentration at 50\% of maximum activity) and LEC (lowest effective concentration) values from the ToxCast data. For 23 of the 35 chemicals, the range of oral equivalent doses for up to 398 ToxCast assays was compared with chronic aggregate human oral exposure estimates in order to assess whether significant in vitro bioactivity occurred within the range of maximum expected human oral exposure. Only 2 of the 35 chemicals, triclosan and pyrithiobac-sodium, had overlapping oral equivalent doses and estimated human oral exposures. Ranking by the potencies of the AC(50) and LEC values, these two chemicals would not have been at the top of a prioritization list. Integrating both dosimetry and human exposure information with the high-throughput toxicity screening efforts provides a better basis for making informed decisions on chemical testing priorities and regulatory attention. Importantly, these tools are necessary to move beyond hazard rankings to estimates of possible in vivo responses based on in vitro screens.},

Disruption of the estrogen signaling pathway has been implicated in a variety of adverse health effects including impaired development, reproduction, and carcinogenesis. The estrogen-responsive human mammary ductal carcinoma cell line T-47D was exposed to 1815 ToxCast chemicals comprising pesticides, industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, cosmetics, food ingredients, and other chemicals with known or suspected human exposure potential. Cell growth kinetics were evaluated using real-time cell electronic sensing. T-47D cells were exposed to eight concentrations (0.006-100 μM), and measurements of cellular impedance were repeatedly recorded for 105 h. Chemical effects were evaluated based on potency (concentration at which response occurs) and efficacy (extent of response). A linear growth response was observed in response to prototypical estrogen receptor agonists (17β-estradiol, genistein, bisphenol A, nonylphenol, and 4-tert-octylphenol). Several compounds, including bisphenol A and genistein, induced cell growth comparable in efficacy to that of 17β-estradiol, but with decreased potency. Progestins, androgens, and corticosteroids invoked a biphasic growth response indicative of changes in cell number or cell morphology. Results from this cell growth assay were compared with results from additional estrogen receptor (ER) binding and transactivation assays. Chemicals detected as active in both the cell growth and ER receptor binding assays demonstrated potencies highly correlated with two ER transactivation assays (r = 0.72; r = 0.70). While ER binding assays detected chemicals that were highly potent or efficacious in the T-47D cell growth and transactivation assays, the binding assays lacked sensitivity in detecting weakly active compounds. In conclusion, this cell-based assay rapidly detects chemical effects on T-47D growth and shows potential, in combination with other HTS assays, to detect environmentally relevant chemicals with potential estrogenic activity.},

The RED device comprises a Teflon base plate which holds up to 48 disposable dialysis cells. Each dialysis insert is made up of two side-by-side chambers separated by a vertical cylinder of dialysis membrane with a high membrane surface area-to-volume ratio. An independent validation of the RED approach for the measurement of human plasma protein binding (PPB) was carried out as a comparative analysis with standard ED evaluating equilibration time, assay reproducibility and accuracy and ease of use. Using a diverse set of 18 commercially available drugs spanning a range of physicochemical properties we have shown this to be a robust and accurate methodology, with a shorter preparation and dialysis time, capable of being automated as a high-throughput assay for the determination of PPB.},

From its inception, DSSTox has focused curation efforts on resolving chemical identifier errors and conflicts in the public domain towards the goal of assigning accurate chemical structures to data and lists of importance to the environmental research and regulatory community. Accurate structure-data associations, in turn, are necessary inputs to structure-based predictive models supporting hazard and risk assessments. In 2014, the legacy, manually curated DSSTox\_V1 content was migrated to a MySQL data model, with modern cheminformatics tools supporting both manual and automated curation processes to increase efficiencies. This was followed by sequential auto-loads of filtered portions of three public datasets: EPA's Substance Registry Services (SRS), the National Library of Medicine's ChemID, and PubChem. This process was constrained by a key requirement of uniquely mapped identifiers (i.e., CAS RN, name and structure) for each substance, rejecting content where any two identifiers were conflicted either within or across datasets. This rejected content highlighted the degree of conflicting, inaccurate substance-structure ID mappings in the public domain, ranging from 12\% (within EPA SRS) to 49\% (across ChemID and PubChem). Substances successfully added to DSSTox from each auto-load were assigned to one of five qc\_levels, conveying curator confidence in each dataset. This process enabled a significant expansion of DSSTox content to provide better coverage of the chemical landscape of interest to environmental scientists, while retaining focus on the accuracy of substance-structure-data associations. Currently, DSSTox serves as the core foundation of EPA's CompTox Chemicals Dashboard [https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard], which provides public access to DSSTox content in support of a broad range of modeling and research activities within EPA and, increasingly, across the field of computational toxicology.},

A previous publication described the rationale behind the selection of an initial set of 75 PFAS, whereas herein, we describe how various category approaches were applied and extended to inform the selection of a second set of 75 PFAS from our library of approximately 430 commercially procured PFAS. In particular, we focus on the challenges in grouping PFAS for prospective analysis and how we have sought to develop and apply objective structure-based categories to profile the testing library and other PFAS inventories. We additionally illustrate how these categories can be enriched with other information to facilitate read-across inferences once experimental data become available. The availability of flexible, objective, reproducible and chemically intuitive categories to explore PFAS constitutes an important step forward in prioritising PFAS for further testing and assessment.},

Literature searches were performed on key words via a variety of search mechanisms, including existing PFAS use and synthesis literature, patent databases, manufacturers' websites, public government databases, and library catalogs. Additional searches were conducted specifically for suspected or known uses. Results PFAS have been used in a wide variety of applications, which are summarized into several industries and applications. The expanded literature search yielded additional references as well as greater details, such as concentrations and specific PFAS used, on several previously reported uses. Conclusions This knowledge will help inform which industries and occupations may lead to potential exposure to workers and to the environment.},

Large amounts of biowastes are added to soil as a source of nutrients and carbon. They also are added as soil amendments to improve soil health and crop productivity. Plant uptake of PFAS through soil application of biowastes is a pathway for animal and human exposure to PFAS. The complexity of PFAS mixtures, and their chemical and thermal stability, make remediation of PFAS in both solid and aqueous matrices challenging. Remediation of PFAS in biowastes, as well as soils treated with these biowastes, can be achieved through preventing and decreasing the concentration of PFAS in biowaste sources (i.e., prevention through source control), mobilization of PFAS in contaminated soil and subsequent removal through leaching (i.e., soil washing) and plant uptake (i.e., phytoremediation), sorption of PFAS, thereby decreasing their mobility and bioavailability (i.e., immobilization), and complete removal through thermal and chemical oxidation (i.e., destruction). In this review, the distribution, bioavailability, and remediation of PFAS in soil receiving solid biowastes, which include biosolids, composts, and manure, are presented.},

In recent years, PFASs have been detected in landfills around the world, among which Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) especially Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) are mostly studied due to their long-term stability. Short-chain PFASs ({\textless}8 carbons) are more common than long-chain PFASs (≧8 carbons) in landfill leachate. PFASs in landfill leachate are eventually transported to the surrounding groundwater, surface water and soil. Some PFASs evaporate from landfills to the ambient air. To avoid the environmental and health risks of PFASs in landfills, new technologies and combined use of existing technologies have been implemented to treat PFASs in landfill leachate. Integrated remediation methods are applied to control the diffusion of PFASs in groundwater surrounding landfills. In future, the mechanisms of PFAAs precursors degradation, the correlation among PFASs in different environmental media around landfills, as well as the environmental behavior and toxic effect of combined pollutants together with PFASs in landfill leachate and surrounding groundwater should be studied.},

To identify landfill liquids that should be prioritized for treatment, this study aimed to evaluate PFAS levels in different aqueous samples from landfills and identify relationships between PFAS and landfill characteristics. Twenty-six PFAS including 11 perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), 7 perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs), and 8 perfluoroalkyl acid precursors (PFAA-precursors) were measured in municipal solid waste (MSW) leachate, construction and demolition debris (CDD) leachate, municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) ash leachate, gas condensate, stormwater, and groundwater from landfills. Based on the median, results show that PFAS levels in MSW leachate were the highest (10,000 ng L−1), CDD leachate were intermediate (6200 ng L−1), and MSWI ash leachate were the lowest (1300 ng L−1) among the leachates evaluated. PFAS levels in gas condensate (7000 ng L−1) were similar to MSW leachate. PFAS in stormwater and groundwater were low (medians were less than 500 ng L−1). Dominant subgroups included PFCAs and PFAA-precursors in all leachates. PFSAs were also found in CDD leachate, PFAA-precursors in gas condensate, and PFCAs in stormwater and groundwater. Landfill characteristics significantly correlated with ∑26PFAS included waste proportions (percentage of MSWI ash in landfill, {\textbar}rs{\textbar} = 0.22), operational status (active or not, {\textbar}rs{\textbar} = 0.27) and rainfall (30-d cumulative rainfall, {\textbar}rs{\textbar} = 0.39).

	abstract = {Background:

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large class of synthetic (man-made) chemicals widely used in consumer products and industrial processes. Thousands of distinct PFAS exist in commerce. The 2019 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Action Plan outlines a multiprogram national research plan to address the challenge of PFAS. One component of this strategy involves the use of systematic evidence map (SEM) approaches to characterize the evidence base for hundreds of PFAS.

Objective:

SEM methods were used to summarize available epidemiological and animal bioassay evidence for a set of 
approximately 150
∼150
∼150
 PFAS that were prioritized in 2019 by the U.S. EPA’s Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) for in vitro toxicity and toxicokinetic assay testing.

Methods:

Systematic review methods were used to identify and screen literature using manual review and machine-learning software. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were kept broad to identify mammalian animal bioassay and epidemiological studies that could inform human hazard identification. A variety of supplemental content was also tracked, including information on in vitro model systems; exposure measurement–only studies in humans; and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Animal bioassay and epidemiology studies meeting PECO criteria were summarized with respect to study design, and health system(s) were assessed. Because animal bioassay studies with 
greater than or equal to 21- day
≥21-d
≥21-d
 exposure duration (or reproductive/developmental study design) were most useful to CCTE analyses, these studies underwent study evaluation and detailed data extraction. All data extraction is publicly available online as interactive visuals with downloadable metadata.

Results:

More than 40,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes identified 44 animal and 148 epidemiology studies from the peer-reviewed literature and 95 animal and 50 epidemiology studies from gray literature that met PECO criteria. Epidemiological evidence (available for 15 PFAS) mostly assessed the reproductive, endocrine, developmental, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune systems. Animal evidence (available for 40 PFAS) commonly assessed effects in the reproductive, developmental, urinary, immunological, and hepatic systems. Overall, 45 PFAS had evidence across animal and epidemiology data streams.

Discussion:

Many of the 
approximately 150
∼150
∼150
 PFAS were data poor. Epidemiological and animal evidence were lacking for most of the PFAS included in our search. By disseminating this information, we hope to facilitate additional assessment work by providing the initial scoping literature survey and identifying key research needs. Future research on data-poor PFAS will help support a more complete understanding of the potential health effects from PFAS exposures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10343},

In recent years, there have been many eﬀorts focused on the challenges involved in read-across development, its scientiﬁc justiﬁcation and documentation for both chemical hazard and risk assessment purposes. Here, we summarise a selection of the read-across frameworks published in technical guidance documents or in the literature, and review their respective similarities and diﬀerences. There was a great deal of consensus between the diﬀerent frameworks in terms of the general steps outlined and the similarity contexts considered although the terminology, decision context (chemical hazard and/or risk assessment purposes) and scope varied. A harmonised hybrid framework is proposed to help reconcile the common guiding principles and steps of the read-across process which should be helpful in expanding the scope and decision context of the existing frameworks. This harmonised framework is also intended to illustrate where generalised and systematic read-across approaches taking into consideration new approach methodology (NAM) information can be applied.},

	abstract = {Read-across is one of the most frequently used alternative tools for hazard assessment, in particular for complex endpoints such as repeated dose or developmental and reproductive toxicity. Read-across extrapolates the outcome of a specific toxicological in vivo endpoint from tested (source) compounds to “similar” (target) compound(s). If appropriately applied, a read-across approach can be used instead of de novo animal testing. The read-across approach starts with structural/ physicochemical similarity between target and source compounds, assuming that similar structural characteristics lead to similar human hazards. In addition, similarity also has to be shown for the toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic properties of the grouped compounds. To date, many read-across cases fail to demonstrate toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic similarities. New concepts, in vitro and in silico tools are needed to better characterise these properties, collectively called new approach methodologies (NAMs). This white paper outlines a general read-across assessment concept using NAMs to support hazard characterization of the grouped compounds by generating data on their dynamic and kinetic properties. Based on the overarching read-across hypothesis, the read-across workflow suggests targeted or untargeted NAM testing also outlining how mechanistic knowledge such as adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) can be utilized. Toxicokinetic models (biokinetic and PBPK), enriched by in vitro parameters such as plasma protein binding and hepatocellular clearance, are proposed to show (dis)similarity of target and source compound toxicokinetics. Furthermore, in vitro to in vivo extrapolation is proposed to predict a human equivalent dose, as potential point of departure for risk assessment. Finally, the generated NAM data are anchored to the existing in vivo data of source compounds to predict the hazard of the target compound in a qualitative and/ or quantitative manner. To build this EU-ToxRisk read-across concept, case studies have been conducted and discussed with the regulatory community. These case studies are briefly outlined.},

This analysis focused on immunosuppressive activity, which was previously reported as an in vivo effect of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), by comparing PFAS responses to four pharmacological immunosuppressants. The PFOS response profile had little correlation with reference immunosuppressants, suggesting in vivo activity does not occur by similar mechanisms. The PFOA response profile did share features with the profile of dexamethasone, although some distinct features were lacking. Other PFAS, including 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl acrylate, demonstrated more similarity to the reference immunosuppressants but with additional activities not found in the reference immunosuppressive drugs. Correlation of PFAS profiles with a database of environmental chemical responses and pharmacological probes identified potential mechanisms of bioactivity for some PFAS, including responses similar to ubiquitin ligase inhibitors, deubiquitylating enzyme (DUB) inhibitors, and thioredoxin reductase inhibitors. Approximately 21\% of the 147 PFAS with confirmed sample quality were bioactive at nominal testing concentrations in the 1-60 micromolar range in these human primary cell systems. These data provide new hypotheses for mechanisms of action for a subset of PFAS and may further aid in development of a PFAS categorization strategy useful in safety assessment.},

However, only a limited number of PFAS are associated with epidemiological or experimental data for hazard identification. To provide developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) hazard information, the work herein employed DNT new approach methods (NAMs) to generate in vitro screening data for a set of 160 PFAS. The DNT NAMs battery was comprised of the microelectrode array neuronal network formation assay (NFA) and high-content imaging (HCI) assays to evaluate proliferation, apoptosis, and neurite outgrowth. The majority of PFAS (118/160) were inactive or equivocal in the DNT NAMs, leaving 42 active PFAS that decreased measures of neural network connectivity and neurite length. Analytical quality control indicated 43/118 inactive PFAS samples and 10/42 active PFAS samples were degraded; as such, careful interpretation is required as some negatives may have been due to loss of the parent PFAS, and some actives may have resulted from a mixture of parent and/or degradants of PFAS. PFAS containing a perfluorinated carbon (C) chain length ≥8, a high C:fluorine ratio, or a carboxylic acid moiety were more likely to be bioactive in the DNT NAMs. Of the PFAS positives in DNT NAMs, 85\% were also active in other EPA ToxCast assays, whereas 79\% of PFAS inactives in the DNT NAMs were active in other assays. These data demonstrate that a subset of PFAS perturb neurodevelopmental processes in vitro and suggest focusing future studies of DNT on PFAS with certain structural feature descriptors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have shown combinations of anti-tumor necrosis factor biologicals plus methotrexate (MTX) are more effective treatments for rheumatoid arthritis than biological monotherapies, based, in part, on the assumption that MTX reduces the immunogenicity of biologicals. However, co-treatment with the anti-interleukin-6 receptor-alpha antibody tocilizumab (TCZ) and MTX does not demonstrate the same level of incremental benefit over TCZ monotherapy. Using the human primary cell based BioMAP phenotypic profiling platform, we investigated the impact of TCZ, adalimumab (ADA), and the small molecule drug tofacitinib (TOF), alone and in combination with MTX, on translational biomarkers that could indicate unique pharmacodynamic interactions outside those of reduced immunogenicity.
METHODS: TCZ, ADA, and TOF, alone and in combination with MTX, were profiled in BioMAP systems at concentrations close to clinical exposure levels: TCZ, 200 μg/ml; TOF1, 1.1 μM; TOF2, 0.12 µM; MTX, 10 μM. Changes in biomarkers were evaluated by statistical methods to determine whether combinations differed from the individual agents.
RESULTS: Although the BioMAP activity profile for TCZ + MTX was not significantly different from that for TCZ alone, profiles for ADA + MTX and TOF1 + MTX or TOF2 + MTX had a greater number of statistically significant different activities (P {\textless} 0.01) than did agents profiled individually.
CONCLUSIONS: These data support the comparable efficacy of TCZ as monotherapy and as combination therapy and suggest that TOF, like ADA, may be more beneficial in combination with MTX. Taking an orthogonal approach to directly compare monotherapy and combination therapies indicates that MTX contributes to the efficacy of some, but not all, RA therapies and can be affected by factors additional to reduced immunogenicity.},

Of critical importance are rapid new approach methodologies to enable the screening of next generation products (NGPs) also known as next generation tobacco and nicotine products. In this study, the activity of conventional cigarette (3R4F) smoke and a range of NGP aerosols (heated tobacco product, hybrid product and electronic vapor product) captured in phosphate buffered saline, were screened by exposing a panel of human cell-based model systems using Biologically Multiplexed Activity Profiling (BioMAP® Diversity PLUS® Panel, Eurofins Discovery). Following exposure, the biological activity for a wide range of biomarkers in the BioMAP panel were compared to determine the presence of toxicity signatures that are associated with specific clinical findings. NGP aerosols were found to be weakly active in the BioMAP Diversity PLUS Panel (≤3/148 biomarkers) whereas significant activity was observed for 3R4F (22/148 biomarkers). Toxicity associated biomarker signatures for 3R4F included immunosuppression, skin irritation and thrombosis, with no toxicity signatures seen for the NGPs. BioMAP profiling could effectively be used to differentiate between complex mixtures of cigarette smoke or NGP aerosol extracts in a panel of human primary cell-based assays. Clinical validation of these results will be critical for confirming the utility of BioMAP for screening NGPs for potential adverse human effects.},

With 1364 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) identified as of interest under Section 8 of the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and concern over the lack of knowledge regarding environmental persistence, human health, and ecological effects, the utility of NAMs to understand potential toxicities and toxicokinetics across these data-poor compounds is being evaluated. To address the TK data deficiency, 71 PFAS selected to span a wide range of functional groups and physico-chemical properties were evaluated for in vitro human plasma protein binding (PPB) by ultracentrifugation with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. For the 67 PFAS successfully evaluated by ultracentrifugation, fraction unbound in plasma (fup) ranged from less than 0.0001 (pentadecafluorooctanoyl chloride) to 0.7302 (tetrafluorosuccinic acid), with over half of the PFAS showing PPB exceeding 99.5\% (fup {\textless} 0.005). Category-based evaluations revealed that perfluoroalkanoyl chlorides and perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs) with 6-10 carbons were the highest bound, with similar median values for alkyl, ether, and polyether PFCAs. Interestingly, binding was lower for the PFCAs with a carbon chain length of ≥11. Lower binding also was noted for fluorotelomer carboxylic acids when compared to their carbon-equivalent perfluoroalkyl acids. Comparisons of the fup value derived using two PPB methods, ultracentrifugation or rapid equilibrium dialysis (RED), revealed RED failure for a subset of PFAS of high mass and/or predicted octanol-water partition coefficients exceeding 4 due to failure to achieve equilibrium. Bayesian modeling was used to provide uncertainty bounds around fup point estimates for incorporation into TK modeling. This PFAS PPB evaluation and grouping exercise across 67 structures greatly expand our current knowledge and will aid in PFAS NAM development.},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) represent a large chemical class lacking hazard, toxicokinetic, and exposure information. To accelerate PFAS hazard evaluation, new approach methodologies (NAMs) comprised of in vitro high-throughput toxicity screening, toxicokinetic data, and computational modeling are being employed in read across strategies to evaluate the larger PFAS landscape. A critical consideration to ensure robust evaluations is a parallel assessment of the quality of the screening stock solutions, where dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is often the diluent of choice. Challenged by the lack of commercially available reference standards for many of the selected PFAS and reliance on mass spectrometry approaches for such an evaluation, we developed a high-throughput framework to evaluate the quality of screening stocks for 205 PFAS selected for these NAM efforts. Using mass spectrometry coupled with either liquid or gas chromatography, a quality scoring system was developed that incorporated observations during mass spectral examination to provide a simple pass or fail notation. Informational flags were used to further describe findings regarding parent analyte presence through accurate mass identification, evidence of contaminants and/or degradation, or further describe characteristics such as isomer presence. Across the PFAS-DMSO stocks tested, 148 unique PFAS received passing quality scores to allow for further in vitro testing whereas 57 received a failing score primarily due to detection issues or confounding effects of DMSO. Principle component analysis indicated vapor pressure and Henry's Law Constant as top indicators for a failed quality score for those analyzed by gas chromatography. Three PFAS in the hexafluoropropylene oxide family failed due to degradation in DMSO. As the PFAS evaluated spanned over 20 different structural categories, additional commentary describes analytical observations across specific groups related to PFAS stock composition, detection, stability, and methodologic considerations that will be useful for informing future analytical assessment and downstream HTS efforts. The high-throughput stock quality scoring workflow presented holds value as a tool to evaluate chemical presence and quality efficiently and for informing data inclusion in PFAS or other NAM screening efforts.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been increased concern for environmental chemicals that can target various sites within the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis to potentially disrupt thyroid synthesis, transport, metabolism, and/or function. One well-known thyroid target in both humans and wildlife is the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) that regulates iodide uptake into the thyroid gland, the first step of thyroid hormone synthesis. Our laboratory previously developed and validated a radioactive iodide uptake (RAIU) high-throughput assay in a stably transduced human NIS cell line (hNIS-HEK293T-EPA) to identify chemicals with potential for NIS inhibition. So far, we have tested over 2000 chemicals (US EPA's ToxCast chemical libraries PI\_v2, PII, and e1K) and discovered a subset of chemicals that significantly inhibit iodide uptake in the hNIS assay. Here, we utilized this screening assay to test a set of 149 unique per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) (ToxCast PFAS library) for potential NIS inhibition. For this evaluation, the 149 blinded samples were screened in a tiered approach, first in an initial single-concentration (≤100 μM) RAIU assay and subsequent evaluation of the chemicals that produced ≥20\% inhibition using multiconcentration (MC) response (0.001-100 μM) testing in parallel RAIU and cell viability assays. Of this set, 38 of the PFAS chemicals inhibited iodide uptake ≥20\% in the MC testing with 25 displaying inhibition ≥50\%. To prioritize the most potent PFAS NIS inhibitors in this set, chemicals were ranked based on outcomes of both iodide uptake and cytotoxicity and normalized to perchlorate, a known positive control. Consistent with previous findings, PFOS and PFHxS were again found to be potent NIS inhibitors, yet significant inhibition was also observed for several other screened PFAS chemicals. Although further studies are clearly warranted, this initial screening effort identifies NIS as a molecular target for potential thyroid disruption by this persistent and structurally diverse class of chemicals.},

With increased chemical curation, currently exceeding 14,000 structures in the PFASSTRUCTV5 inventory on EPA's CompTox Chemicals Dashboard, has come increased motivation to profile, categorize, and analyze the PFAS structure space using modern cheminformatics approaches. Making use of the publicly available ToxPrint chemotypes and ChemoTyper application, we have developed a new PFAS-specific fingerprint set consisting of 129 TxP\_PFAS chemotypes coded in CSRML, a chemical-based XML-query language. These are split into two groups, the first containing 56 mostly bond-type ToxPrints modified to incorporate attachment to either a CF group or F atom to enforce proximity to the fluorinated portion of the chemical. This focus resulted in a dramatic reduction in TxP\_PFAS chemotype counts relative to the corresponding ToxPrint counts (averaging 54\%). The remaining TxP\_PFAS chemotypes consist of various lengths and types of fluorinated chains, rings, and bonding patterns covering indications of branching, alternate halogenation, and fluorotelomers. Both groups of chemotypes are well represented across the PFASSTRUCT inventory. Using the ChemoTyper application, we show how the TxP\_PFAS chemotypes can be visualized, filtered, and used to profile the PFASSTRUCT inventory, as well as to construct chemically intuitive, structure-based PFAS categories. Lastly, we used a selection of expert-based PFAS categories from the OECD Global PFAS list to evaluate a small set of analogous structure-based TxP\_PFAS categories. TxP\_PFAS chemotypes were able to recapitulate the expert-based PFAS category concepts based on clearly defined structure rules that can be computationally implemented and reproducibly applied to process large PFAS inventories without need to consult an expert. The TxP\_PFAS chemotypes have the potential to support computational modeling, harmonize PFAS structure-based categories, facilitate communication, and allow for more efficient and chemically informed exploration of PFAS chemicals moving forward.},

In addition, for many PFAS, including fluorinated ethers such as hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA, or the parent acid of “GenX”), toxicological data are sparse. In general, in vitro testing frequently uses dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a carrier solvent due to its low toxicity, solubility across vast chemical space, and permeation across biological barriers. For PFAS, laboratory practice has assumed that the materials are stable across a wide range of solvents, pHs, and temperatures. In this study, HFPO-DA stability was evaluated with DMSO and other commonly used solvents to determine each solvent’s suitability for use in toxicity assays. The formation of HFPO-DA’s degradation product, heptafluoropropyl 1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl ether (Fluoroether E-1), was monitored by headspace gas chromatography–mass spectrometry over time. These experiments revealed degradation of HFPO-DA to Fluoroether E-1 in DMSO and other aprotic, polar solvents, with half-lives on the order of hours (1, 1.25, and 5.2 h for DMSO, acetone, and acetonitrile, respectively). This rapid degradation suggests the need for caution when performing or using data from toxicity assessments on HFPO-DA and closely related PFAS.},

For environmental and toxicological analysis, it is important to understand the stability of PFASs, including novel per- and polyfluoroalkyl ether acids (PFEAs), in commonly used solvents. In this study, we investigated the effects of PFAS characteristics, solvent type, water-to-organic solvent ratio, and temperature on the stability of 21 PFASs including 18 PFEAs. None of the studied PFASs showed measurable degradation in deionized water, methanol, or isopropyl alcohol over 30 days; however, nine PFEAs degraded in the polar aprotic solvents acetonitrile, acetone, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). PFEA degradation followed first-order kinetics, and first-order rate constants increased with increasing temperature and with decreasing water-to-organic solvent ratio. Monoethers with a carboxylic acid functional group adjacent to a tertiary carbon ({\textgreater}CF-COOH) degraded more rapidly than multiethers in which the carboxylic acid moiety was adjacent to repeating −CF2O– groups. In contrast, monoethers with a carboxylic acid moiety adjacent to a secondary carbon (−CF2-COOH) were stable in all tested solvents. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we determined that PFEAs with a {\textgreater}CF-COOH group were stoichiometrically decarboxylated in aprotic solvents and formed products with a {\textgreater}CFH group; e.g., hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid (HFPO–DA or GenX), HFPO-trimer acid, and HFPO-tetramer acid were stoichiometrically converted to Fluoroethers E-1, E-2, and E-3, respectively. PFEA degradation results highlight the importance of solvent choice when preparing dosing solutions and performing extractions for environmental and toxicological assessments of PFEAs.},

Performance is typically assessed using reference chemicals – compounds with defined activity against the test system target. However, developing reference chemical lists has historically been very resource-intensive. We developed a semi-automated process for selecting and annotating reference chemicals across many targets in a standardized format and demonstrate the workflow here. A series of required fields defines the potential reference chemical: the in vitro molecular target, pathway, or phenotype affected; and the chemical’s mode (e.g. agonist, antagonist, inhibitor). Activity information was computationally extracted into a database from multiple public sources including non-curated scientific literature and curated chemical-biological databases, resulting in the identification of chemical activity in 2995 biological targets. Sample data from literature sources covering 54 molecular targets ranging from data-poor to data-rich was manually checked for accuracy. Precision rates were 82.7\% from curated data sources and 39.5\% from automated literature extraction. We applied the final reference chemical lists to evaluating performance of EPA’s ToxCast program in vitro bioassays. The level of support, i.e., the number of independent reports in the database linking a chemical to a target, was found to strongly correlate with likelihood of positive results in the ToxCast assays, although individual assay performance had considerable variation. This overall approach allows rapid development of candidate reference chemical lists for a wide variety of targets that can facilitate performance evaluation of in vitro assays as a critical step in imparting confidence in alternative approaches.},

Chemical inhibition of deiodinase activity has been identified as an important endpoint to include in screening chemicals for thyroid hormone disruption. To address the lack of data regarding chemicals that inhibit the deiodinase enzymes, we developed robust in vitro assays that utilized human deiodinase types 1, 2, and 3 and screened over 1800 unique chemicals from the U.S. EPA's ToxCast phase 1\_v2, phase 2, and e1k libraries. Initial testing at a single concentration identified 411 putative deiodinase inhibitors that produced inhibition of 20\% or greater in at least 1 of the 3 deiodinase assays, including chemicals that have not previously been shown to inhibit deiodinases. Of these, 228 chemicals produced enzyme inhibition of 50\% or greater; these chemicals were further tested in concentration-response to determine relative potency. Comparisons across these deiodinase assays identified 81 chemicals that produced selective inhibition, with 50\% inhibition or greater of only 1 of the deiodinases. This set of 3 deiodinase inhibition assays provides a significant contribution toward expanding the limited number of in vitro assays used to identify chemicals with the potential to interfere with thyroid hormone homeostasis. In addition, these results set the groundwork for development and evaluation of structure-activity relationships for deiodinase inhibition, and inform targeted selection of chemicals for further testing to identify adverse outcomes of deiodinase inhibition.},

With recombinant human IYD enzyme, a 96-well plate in vitro assay was developed and then used to screen over 1800 unique substances from the U.S. EPA ToxCast screening library. Through a tiered screening approach, 194 IYD inhibitors were identified (inhibited IYD enzyme activity by 20\% or greater at target concentration of 200 μM). 154 chemicals were further tested in concentration-response (0.032-200 μM) to determine IC50 and rank-order potency.

To fill 1 critical screening gap, the Amplex UltraRed-thyroperoxidase (AUR-TPO) assay was developed to identify chemicals that inhibit TPO, as decreased TPO activity reduces TH synthesis. The ToxCast phase I and II chemical libraries, comprised of 1074 unique chemicals, were initially screened using a single, high concentration to identify potential TPO inhibitors. Chemicals positive in the single-concentration screen were retested in concentration-response. Due to high false-positive rates typically observed with loss-of-signal assays such as AUR-TPO, we also employed 2 additional assays in parallel to identify possible sources of nonspecific assay signal loss, enabling stratification of roughly 300 putative TPO inhibitors based upon selective AUR-TPO activity. A cell-free luciferase inhibition assay was used to identify nonspecific enzyme inhibition among the putative TPO inhibitors, and a cytotoxicity assay using a human cell line was used to estimate the cellular tolerance limit. Additionally, the TPO inhibition activities of 150 chemicals were compared between the AUR-TPO and an orthogonal peroxidase oxidation assay using guaiacol as a substrate to confirm the activity profiles of putative TPO inhibitors. This effort represents the most extensive TPO inhibition screening campaign to date and illustrates a tiered screening approach that focuses resources, maximizes assay throughput, and reduces animal use.},

	abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl-ethers (PBDEs) are metabolized into hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PCBs/PBDEs), which can disrupt the thyroid hormone homeostasis. Binding of these metabolites to transport proteins such as transthyretin (TTR) is an important mechanism of their toxicity. Several methods to quantify the competitive thyroxine (T(4)) displacement potency of pure metabolites exist. However, quantification of the potency of in vitro metabolized PCBs and PBDEs has drawbacks related to the coextraction of compounds disturbing the T(4)-TTR competitive binding assay. This study identifies and quantifies the major coextractants namely cholesterol, saturated and nonsaturated fatty acids (SFA and NSFA) at levels above 20 nmol per mg equivalent protein following various extraction methods. Their TTR binding potency was analyzed in a downscaled, nonradioactive fluorescence displacement assay. At concentration factors needed for TTR competitive binding, at least 10μM of these coextracts is present, whereas individual SFA and NSFA disturb the assay from 0.3μM. The effectiveness of the in vitro metabolism and extraction of the model compounds CB 77 and BDE 47 was chemically quantified with a newly developed chromatographic method analyzing silylated derivatives of the OH-metabolites and coextractants. A new method to selectively extract metabolites and limit coextraction of disturbing compounds to less than 5 nmol per mg equivalent protein is presented. It is now possible to make a dose-response curve up to 50\% inhibition with bioactivated CB 77 and BDE 47. The toxic potencies of bioactivated persistent organic pollutants (POPs) should be taken into account to prevent serious underestimation of their hazard and risk.},

Here, we report data to support selective bromodomain blockade of the transcriptional coactivators CBP (CREB binding protein) and p300 as an alternative approach to inhibit human Th17 responses. We show that CBP30 has marked molecular specificity for the bromodomains of CBP and p300, compared with 43 other bromodomains. In unbiased cellular testing on a diverse panel of cultured primary human cells, CBP30 reduced immune cell production of IL-17A and other proinflammatory cytokines. CBP30 also inhibited IL-17A secretion by Th17 cells from healthy donors and patients with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. Transcriptional profiling of human T cells after CBP30 treatment showed a much more restricted effect on gene expression than that observed with the pan-BET (bromo and extraterminal domain protein family) bromodomain inhibitor JQ1. This selective targeting of the CBP/p300 bromodomain by CBP30 will potentially lead to fewer side effects than with the broadly acting epigenetic inhibitors currently in clinical trials.},

Our approach, the US Environmental Protection Agency's ToxCast program, utilizes a large suite of in vitro and model organism assays to interrogate important chemical libraries and computationally analyze bioactivity profiles. Here we evaluated one component of the ToxCast program, the use of primary human cell systems, by screening for chemicals that disrupt physiologically important pathways. Chemical-response signatures for 87 endpoints covering molecular functions relevant to toxic and therapeutic pathways were generated in eight cell systems for 641 environmental chemicals and 135 reference pharmaceuticals and failed drugs. Computational clustering of the profiling data provided insights into the polypharmacology and potential off-target effects for many chemicals that have limited or no toxicity information. The endpoints measured can be closely linked to in vivo outcomes, such as the upregulation of tissue factor in endothelial cell systems by compounds linked to the risk of thrombosis in vivo. Our results demonstrate that assaying complex biological pathways in primary human cells can identify potential chemical targets, toxicological liabilities and mechanisms useful for elucidating adverse outcome pathways.},

However, relying on nominal assay concentrations may misrepresent potential in vivo effects of these chemicals due to differences in bioavailability, clearance, and exposure. Hepatic metabolic clearance and plasma protein binding were experimentally measured for 239 ToxCast Phase I chemicals. The experimental data were used in a population-based in vitro–to–in vivo extrapolation model to estimate the daily human oral dose, called the oral equivalent dose, necessary to produce steady-state in vivo blood concentrations equivalent to in vitro AC50 (concentration at 50\% of maximum activity) or lowest effective concentration values across more than 500 in vitro assays. The estimated steady-state oral equivalent doses associated with the in vitro assays were compared with chronic aggregate human oral exposure estimates to assess whether in vitro bioactivity would be expected at the dose-equivalent level of human exposure. A total of 18 (9.9\%) chemicals for which human oral exposure estimates were available had oral equivalent doses at levels equal to or less than the highest estimated U.S. population exposures. Ranking the chemicals by nominal assay concentrations would have resulted in different chemicals being prioritized. The in vitro assay endpoints with oral equivalent doses lower than the human exposure estimates included cell growth kinetics, cytokine and cytochrome P450 expression, and cytochrome P450 inhibition. The incorporation of dosimetry and exposure provide necessary context for interpretation of in vitro toxicity screening data and are important considerations in determining chemical testing priorities.},

The primary objective of this work was to compare PODs based on high-throughput predictions of bioactivity, exposure predictions, and traditional hazard information for 448 chemicals. PODs derived from new approach methodologies (NAMs) were obtained for this comparison using the 50th (PODNAM, 50) and the 95th (PODNAM, 95) percentile credible interval estimates for the steady-state plasma concentration used in in vitro to in vivo extrapolation of administered equivalent doses. Of the 448 substances, 89\% had a PODNAM, 95 that was less than the traditional POD (PODtraditional) value. For the 48 substances for which PODtraditional {\textless} PODNAM, 95, the PODNAM and PODtraditional were typically within a factor of 10 of each other, and there was an enrichment of chemical structural features associated with organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. When PODtraditional {\textless} PODNAM, 95, it did not appear to result from an enrichment of PODtraditional based on a particular study type (eg, developmental, reproductive, and chronic studies). Bioactivity:exposure ratios, useful for identification of substances with potential priority, demonstrated that high-throughput exposure predictions were greater than the PODNAM, 95 for 11 substances. When compared with threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) values, the PODNAM, 95 was greater than the corresponding TTC value 90\% of the time. This work demonstrates the feasibility, and continuing challenges, of using in vitro bioactivity as a protective estimate of POD in screening-level assessments via a case study.},

	abstract = {In support of the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP), the U.S.EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) is developing high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches to identify chemicals that alter target sites in the thyroid hormone (TH) pathway. The sodium iodide symporter (NIS) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates iodide uptake into the thyroid as the initial step of TH biosynthesis. Previously, we screened 293 ToxCast chemicals (ph1v2) using a HEK293T cell line expressing human NIS in parallel radioactive iodide uptake (RAIU) and cell viability assays to identify potential environmental NIS inhibitors. Here, we expanded NIS inhibitor screening for a set of 768 ToxCast Phase II (ph2) chemicals, and applied a novel computational toxicology approach based on the ToxPrint chemotype to identify chemical substructures associated with NIS inhibition. Following single-concentration screening (at 1 × 10-4 M with a 20\% inhibition cutoff), 235 samples (228 chemicals) were further tested in multiple-concentration (1 × 10-9 - 1 × 10-4 M) format in both RAIU and cell viability assays. The 167 chemicals that exhibited significant RAIU inhibition were then prioritized using combined RAIU and cell viability responses that were normalized relative to the known NIS inhibitor sodium perchlorate. Some of the highest ranked chemicals, such as PFOS, tributyltin chloride, and triclocarban, have been previously reported to be thyroid disruptors. In addition, several novel chemicals were identified as potent NIS inhibitors. The present results were combined with the previous ph1v2 screening results to produce two spaulets of binary hit-calls for 1028 unique chemicals, consisting of 273 positives exhibiting significant RAIU inhibition, and 63 positives following application of a cell viability filter. A ToxPrint chemotype-enrichment analysis identified {\textgreater}20 distinct chemical substructural features, represented in {\textgreater}60\% of the active chemicals, as significantly enriched in each NIS inhibition hit-call space. A shared set of 9 chemotypes enriched in both hit-call sets indicates stable chemotype signals (insensitive to cytotoxicity filters) that can help guide structure-activity relationship (SAR) investigations and inform future research.},

The toxicokinetics of most PFAS are currently uncharacterized, but long half-lives (t½) have been observed in some cases. Knowledge of chemical-specific t½ is necessary for exposure reconstruction and extrapolation from toxicological studies. We used an ensemble machine learning method, random forest, to model the existing in vivo measured t½ across four species (human, monkey, rat, mouse) and eleven PFAS. Mechanistically motivated descriptors were examined, including two types of surrogates for renal transporters: (1) physiological descriptors, including kidney geometry, for renal transporter expression and (2) structural similarity of defluorinated PFAS to endogenous chemicals for transporter affinity. We developed a classification model for t½ (Bin 1: {\textless}12 h; Bin 2: {\textless}1 week; Bin 3: {\textless}2 months; Bin 4: {\textgreater}2 months). The model had an accuracy of 86.1\% in contrast to 32.2\% for a y-randomized null model. A total of 3890 compounds were within domain of the model, and t½ was predicted using the bin medians: 4.9 h, 2.2 days, 33 days, and 3.3 years. For human t½, 56\% of PFAS were classified in Bin 4, 7\% were classified in Bin 3, and 37\% were classified in Bin 2.

In this study, some basic information concerning PFASs is reviewed, focusing mainly on PFAAs (perfluoroalkyl acids). We have made efforts to systemize their division into groups according to chemical structure, describe their basic physicochemical properties, characterize production technologies, and determine potential human exposure routes with particular reference to oral exposure. A variety of possible toxicological effects to human health are also discussed. In response to increasing public concern about the toxicity of PFAAs, an evaluation of dietary intake has been undertaken for two of the most commonly known PFAAs: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). As summarized in this study, PFAAs levels need further assessment due to the science-based TWI standards laid down by the EFSA’s CONTAM Panel regarding the risk to human health posed by the presence of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid and perfluorooctanoic acid in food (tolerable weekly intakes of PFOA and PFOS set up to 6 ng·kg−1·bw·week−1 and 13 ng·kg−1·bw·week−1, respectively).

	abstract = {In this review article, we compiled peer-reviewed literature describing PFAS exposure and reproductive effects in animals and humans. The aim was to compare environmental occurrence and effects of the most prominent long-chain PFAS compounds and their short-chain replacements. Long-chain PFAS compounds are known to persist in the environment due to their chemical stability, and also known to bioaccumulate; hence, these compounds are being replaced globally. Indeed, PFOA and PFOS are considered long-chain “forever pollutants,” and thus the potential reproductive risk may continue for decades. Much less is known about their short-chain replacements despite the fact that they becoming more widespread in the environment. Short-chain PFAS are generally less bioaccumulative than long-chain, but they are more mobile and persistent in aquatic ecosystems. The three most prominent of these are commonly referred to as GenX, ADONA and F53B. The short-chain PFAS have similar physical and chemical properties as their predecessors; however, because they are relatively new, much less is known about the potential to disrupt reproduction. Indeed, high-quality epidemiological studies are needed to determine associations between short-chain PFAS exposure and effects on reproductive health. However, epidemiological evidence is mounting that long-chain PFAS exposure is associated with reproductive effects (i.e., decrease in fertility, reduced fetal growth and birth weight, pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia, thyroid hormone disruption during pregnancy, and preterm birth). Evidence from animal models and human cell lines indicates that short-chain PFAS similarly affect reproductive endpoints; however, epidemiological studies are scarce and inconsistent. Although short-chain PFAS have been quantified in drinking water and sediment worldwide, most of these studies did not focus on quantitation of GenX, ADONA, and F53B. There are also many other short-chain PFAS byproducts of manufacturing that have yet to be identified and studied. When sum total concentration of long- and short-chain PFAS are considered, the concentration rises by an order or magnitude or greater, as will the risk of exposure and subsequent reproductive effects.},

	abstract = {Chemical toxicity can arise from disruption of specific biomolecular functions or through more generalized cell stress and cytotoxicity-mediated processes. Here, responses of 1060 chemicals including pharmaceuticals, natural products, pesticidals, consumer, and industrial chemicals across a battery of 815 in vitro assay endpoints from 7 high-throughput assay technology platforms were analyzed in order to distinguish between these types of activities. Both cell-based and cell-free assays showed a rapid increase in the frequency of responses at concentrations where cell stress/cytotoxicity responses were observed in cell-based assays. Chemicals that were positive on at least 2 viability/cytotoxicity assays within the concentration range tested (typically up to 100 μM) activated a median of 12\% of assay endpoints whereas those that were not cytotoxic in this concentration range activated 1.3\% of the assays endpoints. The results suggest that activity can be broadly divided into: (1) specific biomolecular interactions against one or more targets (eg, receptors or enzymes) at concentrations below which overt cytotoxicity-associated activity is observed; and (2) activity associated with cell stress or cytotoxicity, which may result from triggering specific cell stress pathways, chemical reactivity, physico-chemical disruption of proteins or membranes, or broad low-affinity non-covalent interactions. Chemicals showing a greater number of specific biomolecular interactions are generally designed to be bioactive (pharmaceuticals or pesticidal active ingredients), whereas intentional food-use chemicals tended to show the fewest specific interactions. The analyses presented here provide context for use of these data in ongoing studies to predict in vivo toxicity from chemicals lacking extensive hazard assessment.},

One of the main issues hindering read-across acceptance is the notion of addressing and reducing uncertainties. Frameworks and formats have been created to help facilitate read-across development, evaluation, and residual uncertainties. However, read-across remains an expert-driven approach with each assessment decided on its own merits with no objective means of evaluating performance or quantifying uncertainties. Here, the underlying motivation of creating an algorithmic approach to read-across, namely the Generalised Read-Across (GenRA) approach, is described. The overall objectives of the approach were to quantify performance and uncertainty. Progress made in quantifying the impact of each similarity context commonly relied upon as part of read-across assessment are discussed. The framework underpinning the approach, the software tools developed to date and how GenRA can be used to make and interpret predictions as part of a screening level hazard assessment decision context are illustrated. Future directions and some of the overarching issues still needed in this field and the extent to which GenRA might facilitate those needs are discussed.},

	abstract = {The collection of chemical structure information and associated experimental data for quantitative structure-activity/property relationship (QSAR/QSPR) modeling is facilitated by an increasing number of public databases containing large amounts of useful data. However, the performance of QSAR models highly depends on the quality of the data and modeling methodology used. This study aims to develop robust QSAR/QSPR models for chemical properties of environmental interest that can be used for regulatory purposes. This study primarily uses data from the publicly available PHYSPROP database consisting of a set of 13 common physicochemical and environmental fate properties. These datasets have undergone extensive curation using an automated workflow to select only high-quality data, and the chemical structures were standardized prior to calculation of the molecular descriptors. The modeling procedure was developed based on the five Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) principles for QSAR models. A weighted k-nearest neighbor approach was adopted using a minimum number of required descriptors calculated using PaDEL, an open-source software. The genetic algorithms selected only the most pertinent and mechanistically interpretable descriptors (2-15, with an average of 11 descriptors). The sizes of the modeled datasets varied from 150 chemicals for biodegradability half-life to 14,050 chemicals for logP, with an average of 3222 chemicals across all endpoints. The optimal models were built on randomly selected training sets (75\%) and validated using fivefold cross-validation (CV) and test sets (25\%). The CV Q2 of the models varied from 0.72 to 0.95, with an average of 0.86 and an R2 test value from 0.71 to 0.96, with an average of 0.82. Modeling and performance details are described in QSAR model reporting format and were validated by the European Commission's Joint Research Center to be OECD compliant. All models are freely available as an open-source, command-line application called OPEn structure-activity/property Relationship App (OPERA). OPERA models were applied to more than 750,000 chemicals to produce freely available predicted data on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's CompTox Chemistry Dashboard.},

Currently, many different PFAS (on the order of several thousands) are used in a wide range of applications, and there is no comprehensive source of information on the many individual substances and their functions in different applications. Here we provide a broad overview of many use categories where PFAS have been employed and for which function; we also specify which PFAS have been used and discuss the magnitude of the uses. Despite being non-exhaustive, our study clearly demonstrates that PFAS are used in almost all industry branches and many consumer products. In total, more than 200 use categories and subcategories are identified for more than 1400 individual PFAS. In addition to well-known categories such as textile impregnation, fire-fighting foam, and electroplating, the identified use categories also include many categories not described in the scientific literature, including PFAS in ammunition, climbing ropes, guitar strings, artificial turf, and soil remediation. We further discuss several use categories that may be prioritised for finding PFAS-free alternatives. Besides the detailed description of use categories, the present study also provides a list of the identified PFAS per use category, including their exact masses for future analytical studies aiming to identify additional PFAS.},

These OEDs were compared against regulatory exposure estimates, providing an activity-to-exposure ratio (AER) useful for a risk-based ranking strategy. As ToxCast efforts expand (ie, Phase II) beyond food-use pesticides toward a wider chemical domain that lacks exposure and toxicity information, prediction tools become increasingly important. In this study, in vitro hepatic clearance and plasma protein binding were measured to estimate OEDs for a subset of Phase II chemicals. OEDs were compared against high-throughput (HT) exposure predictions generated using probabilistic modeling and Bayesian approaches generated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ExpoCast program. This approach incorporated chemical-specific use and national production volume data with biomonitoring data to inform the exposure predictions. This HT exposure modeling approach provided predictions for all Phase II chemicals assessed in this study whereas estimates from regulatory sources were available for only 7\% of chemicals. Of the 163 chemicals assessed in this study, 3 or 13 chemicals possessed AERs \&lt; 1 or \&lt; 100, respectively. Diverse bioactivities across a range of assays and concentrations were also noted across the wider chemical space surveyed.

	abstract = {The present study adapted an existing high content imaging-based high-throughput phenotypic profiling (HTPP) assay known as "Cell Painting" for bioactivity screening of environmental chemicals. This assay uses a combination of fluorescent probes to label a variety of organelles and measures a large number of phenotypic features at the single cell level in order to detect chemical-induced changes in cell morphology. First, a small set of candidate phenotypic reference chemicals (n = 14) known to produce changes in the cellular morphology of U-2 OS cells were identified and screened at multiple time points in concentration-response format. Many of these chemicals produced distinct cellular phenotypes that were qualitatively similar to those previously described in the literature. A novel workflow for phenotypic feature extraction, concentration-response modeling and determination of in vitro thresholds for chemical bioactivity was developed. Subsequently, a set of 462 chemicals from the ToxCast library were screened in concentration-response mode. Bioactivity thresholds were calculated and converted to administered equivalent doses (AEDs) using reverse dosimetry. AEDs were then compared to effect values from mammalian toxicity studies. In many instances (68\%), the HTPP-derived AEDs were either more conservative than or comparable to the in vivo effect values. Overall, we conclude that the HTPP assay can be used as an efficient, cost-effective and reproducible screening method for characterizing the biological activity and potency of environmental chemicals for potential use in in vitro-based safety assessments.},

Technological advancements in gene expression assays have made in vitro high-throughput transcriptomics (HTTr) a feasible option for NAMs-based hazard characterization of environmental chemicals. In this study, we evaluated the Templated Oligo with Sequencing Readout (TempO-Seq) assay for HTTr concentration-response screening of a small set of chemicals in the human-derived MCF7 cell model. Our experimental design included a variety of reference samples and reference chemical treatments in order to objectively evaluate TempO-Seq assay performance. To facilitate analysis of these data, we developed a robust and scalable bioinformatics pipeline using open-source tools. We also developed a novel gene expression signature-based concentration-response modeling approach and compared the results to a previously implemented workflow for concentration-response analysis of transcriptomics data using BMDExpress. Analysis of reference samples and reference chemical treatments demonstrated highly reproducible differential gene expression signatures. In addition, we found that aggregating signals from individual genes into gene signatures prior to concentration-response modeling yielded in vitro transcriptional biological pathway altering concentrations (BPACs) that were closely aligned with previous ToxCast high-throughput screening assays. Often these identified signatures were associated with the known molecular target of the chemicals in our test set as the most sensitive components of the overall transcriptional response. This work has resulted in a novel and scalable in vitro HTTr workflow that is suitable for high-throughput hazard evaluation of environmental chemicals.},

	abstract = {Despite an abundance of online databases providing access to chemical data, there is increasing demand for high-quality, structure-curated, open data to meet the various needs of the environmental sciences and computational toxicology communities. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) web-based CompTox Chemistry Dashboard is addressing these needs by integrating diverse types of relevant domain data through a cheminformatics layer, built upon a database of curated substances linked to chemical structures. These data include physicochemical, environmental fate and transport, exposure, usage, in vivo toxicity, and in vitro bioassay data, surfaced through an integration hub with link-outs to additional EPA data and public domain online resources. Batch searching allows for direct chemical identifier (ID) mapping and downloading of multiple data streams in several different formats. This facilitates fast access to available structure, property, toxicity, and bioassay data for collections of chemicals (hundreds to thousands at a time). Advanced search capabilities are available to support, for example, non-targeted analysis and identification of chemicals using mass spectrometry. The contents of the chemistry database, presently containing {\textasciitilde} 760,000 substances, are available as public domain data for download. The chemistry content underpinning the Dashboard has been aggregated over the past 15 years by both manual and auto-curation techniques within EPA's DSSTox project. DSSTox chemical content is subject to strict quality controls to enforce consistency among chemical substance-structure identifiers, as well as list curation review to ensure accurate linkages of DSSTox substances to chemical lists and associated data. The Dashboard, publicly launched in April 2016, has expanded considerably in content and user traffic over the past year. It is continuously evolving with the growth of DSSTox into high-interest or data-rich domains of interest to EPA, such as chemicals on the Toxic Substances Control Act listing, while providing the user community with a flexible and dynamic web-based platform for integration, processing, visualization and delivery of data and resources. The Dashboard provides support for a broad array of research and regulatory programs across the worldwide community of toxicologists and environmental scientists.},

	doi = {10.1021/ci500667v},
	abstract = {Chemotypes are a new approach for representing molecules, chemical substructures and patterns, reaction rules, and reactions. Chemotypes are capable of integrating types of information beyond what is possible using current representation methods (e.g., SMARTS patterns) or reaction transformations (e.g., SMIRKS, reaction SMILES). Chemotypes are expressed in the XML-based Chemical Subgraphs and Reactions Markup Language (CSRML), and can be encoded not only with connectivity and topology but also with properties of atoms, bonds, electronic systems, or molecules. CSRML has been developed in parallel with a public set of chemotypes, i.e., the ToxPrint chemotypes, which are designed to provide excellent coverage of environmental, regulatory, and commercial-use chemical space, as well as to represent chemical patterns and properties especially relevant to various toxicity concerns. A software application, ChemoTyper has also been developed and made publicly available in order to enable chemotype searching and fingerprinting against a target structure set. The public ChemoTyper houses the ToxPrint chemotype CSRML dictionary, as well as reference implementation so that the query specifications may be adopted by other chemical structure knowledge systems. The full specifications of the XML-based CSRML standard used to express chemotypes are publicly available to facilitate and encourage the exchange of structural knowledge.},

	abstract = {The concept of molecular similarity is one of the central ideas in cheminformatics, despite the fact that it is ill-defined and rather difficult to assess objectively. Here we propose a practical definition of molecular similarity in the context of drug discovery: molecules A and B are similar if a medicinal chemist would be likely to synthesise and test them around the same time as part of the same medicinal chemistry program. The attraction of such a definition is that it matches one of the key uses of similarity measures in early-stage drug discovery. If we make the assumption that molecules in the same compound activity table in a medicinal chemistry paper were considered similar by the authors of the paper, we can create a dataset of similar molecules from the medicinal chemistry literature. Furthermore, molecules with decreasing levels of similarity to a reference can be found by either ordering molecules in an activity table by their activity, or by considering activity tables in different papers which have at least one molecule in common.},

Historically, topological fingerprints were developed for substructure and similarity searching. ECFPs were developed specifically for structure−activity modeling. ECFPs are circular fingerprints with a number of useful qualities: they can be very rapidly calculated; they are not predefined and can represent an essentially infinite number of different molecular features (including stereochemical information); their features represent the presence of particular substructures, allowing easier interpretation of analysis results; and the ECFP algorithm can be tailored to generate different types of circular fingerprints, optimized for different uses. While the use of ECFPs has been widely adopted and validated, a description of their implementation has not previously been presented in the literature.},

Wide use and integration of these data can benefit from an efficient, transparent and reproducible data pipeline. Summary: The tcpl R package and its associated MySQL database provide a generalized platform for efficiently storing, normalizing and dose-response modeling of large high-throughput and high-content chemical screening data. The novel dose-response modeling algorithm has been tested against millions of diverse dose-response series, and robustly fits data with outliers and cytotoxicity-related signal loss.
