  Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of man-made chemicals that are in widespread use and many present concerns for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity. Whilst a handful of PFAS have been characterized for their hazard profiles, the vast majority have not been extensively studied. Herein, a chemical category approach was developed and applied to PFAS that could be readily characterized by a chemical structure. The PFAS definition as described in the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Inactive Significant New Use Rule (SNUR) was applied to the Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) database to retrieve an initial list of 12,456 PFAS. Plausible degradation products from the 617 PFAS on the non-confidential TSCA Inventory were simulated using the Catalogic expert system, and the unique PFAS degradants (2959) were added to the list resulting in a set of 15,415 PFAS. Each PFAS was then assigned into a primary category using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) structure-based classifications. The primary categories were subdivided into secondary categories based on a chain length threshold (>=7 vs <7). Secondary categories were subcategorized using chemical fingerprints to achieve a balance between total number of structural categories vs. level of structural similarity within a category based on the Jaccard index. A set of 90 terminal structural categories were derived from which a subset of representative candidates could be proposed for potential data collection, taking into account considerations such as the sparsity of relevant toxicity data within each category, presence on environmental monitoring lists, and the ability to identify plausible manufacturers/importers. Refinements to the approach considering ways in which the categories could be updated by mechanistic data and physicochemical property information are also described. This categorization approach shows promise as a means to identify candidates for data collection with related applications in QSAR development, read-across and hazard assessment.

## Introduction

### Background

Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large class of man-made chemicals that have been manufactured and used in a variety of industries since the 1940s [@wang_never-ending_2017; @gluge_overview_2020; @gaines_historical_2023]. PFAS have been or are currently being synthesized for a myriad of different uses, including adhesives, stain resistant coatings for clothes or furniture and fire retardants. In addition to consumer and industrial applications, PFAS are being released into the environment during manufacturing and use [@wallis_source_2023]. PFAS and products containing them are regularly disposed of in landfills or incinerated which can also lead to further release into soil, groundwater, and air [@chen_evaluation_2023; @li_critical_2023]. They are also found in biosolids from wastewater treatment facilities which have been spread onto agricultural fields [@bolan_distribution_2021].

Characterizing the scope and scale of the 'PFAS class' has been challenging in the absence of a harmonized PFAS definition. Some have cited thousands of PFAS being in the environment (estimates range from 4700 [@oecd_reconciling_2021] to greater than 10,000 [@gaber_devil_nodate]), but there is likely to be an increasing number identified given that analytical methods are continually being evolved to detect them. An Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) working group defined PFAS as 'fluorinated substances that contain at least one fully fluorinated methyl or methylene carbon atom (without any H/Cl/Br/I atom attached to it); that is, any chemical with at least a perfluorinated methyl group (--CF3) or a perfluorinated methylene group (--CF2--)' [@oecd_reconciling_2021; @wang_new_2021]. This broad OECD definition would make estimates of a few thousand PFAS too low; however, the OECD working group also acknowledges that a chemistry definition of PFAS does not equate to how PFAS should be necessarily assessed in terms of their hazard profile or to what extent subcategorizations of PFAS are appropriate depending on different legislative frameworks. Indeed, if the OECD definition were applied to a large inventory such as the US EPA's Distributed Structure-Searchable (DSSTox) Database project [@grulke_epas_2019] estimates of the number of PFAS would be in the range of 30,000 members. For contrast, PubChem's Classification Browser (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/classification/#hid=120) has tagged over 7 million substances as meeting the OECD PFAS definition [@schymanski_per-_2023]. Any substance containing a CF3 would be classified as a "PFAS" even though it might fall within the remit of other regulatory frameworks. The US EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) recently proposed a structural definition for defining PFAS for the purposes of a rule that requires EPA review and approval prior to manufacturing and/or processing a chemical substance meeting the definition that is not currently "active in U.S. commerce" as provided by TSCA. This proposal is known as the TSCA Inactive Significant New Use Rule (SNUR) [@epa_2023]. This definition is narrower in scope than the OECD chemistry definition yet still identifies several thousand PFAS candidates. Under the proposed TSCA Inactive SNUR, a PFAS is defined as 'including at least one of three substructures: 1) R-(CF2)-CF(R')R'', where both the CF2 and CF moieties are saturated carbons; 2) R-CF2OCF2-R', where R and R' can either be F, O, or saturated carbons; and 3) CF3C(CF3)R'R'', where R' and R'' can either be F or saturated carbons. 

Of the many thousands of PFAS, few have been studied extensively in terms of their toxicity profile. Beyond PFAS such as perfluoroocanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), the vast majority of PFAS lack data to facilitate a robust characterization of their potential toxicity [@carlson_systematic_2022]. In an effort to address these data gaps, Congress directed EPA (15 USC 8962) to develop a process for prioritizing which PFAS or 'class' of PFAS should be subject to additional research efforts based on potential for human exposure to, potential toxicity of, and other available information. This is described in more detail in EPA's National Testing Strategy \[https://www.epa.gov/assessing-and-managing-chemicals-under-tsca/national-pfas-testing-strategy\] that was published in October 2021.

The notion of a 'class' underpins grouping approaches which includes the concept of developing categories to perform associated read-across. Rather than assessing each PFAS individually, closely related PFAS could be, in principle, grouped together into categories. Thus, in a category approach, not every PFAS needs to be tested for every single endpoint. Instead, the overall data for that category could potentially prove applicable to support a hazard assessment for other members of the category.

Grouping approaches have been in use in regulatory programmes for many years dating back to 1998 when guidance was developed by the EPA in support of the US High Production Volume (HPV) Challenge Program [@usepa_2004_hpv] (https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P1004QXK.TXT). The concepts of grouping, categories and read-across are extensively described in OECD's grouping guidance document, last revised in 2017 [@oecd_guidance_2017] and presently undergoing revision. Moreover, the state of art in read-across has been described extensively in the literature; from workflows which outline the steps undertaken to develop category and analogue approaches through to the evaluation, justification and documentation of the read-across prediction made [@cronin_chapter_2013; @escher_towards_2019; @patlewicz_navigating_2018; @patlewicz_towards_2023]. More recently the notion of enhancing structure-based groupings with new approach methods (NAMs) has also been an evolving topic. For example, to what extent can structural categories be further justified by NAM data by providing a mechanistic underpinning [@escher_towards_2019; @patlewicz_navigating_2018; @patlewicz_towards_2022; @patlewicz_towards_2023]. Indeed, EPA has been leading a research programme to test a targeted set of \~150 PFAS through an array of different NAM approaches as part of a category approach [@carstens_evaluation_2023; @houck_bioactivity_2021; @houck_evaluation_2023; @kreutz_category-based_2023; @patlewicz_towards_2022; @smeltz_plasma_2023; @smeltz_targeted_2023; @stoker_high-throughput_2023].

This study describes the approach taken to further refine a relevant PFAS landscape of interest to EPA from which an initial set of structural categories were derived. The work here is a continuation of the initial categorization efforts described in the EPA National Testing Strategy \[https://www.epa.gov/assessing-and-managing-chemicals-under-tsca/national-pfas-testing-strategy\]. For the set of categories developed, the data gaps were assessed to help identify which categories were particularly data poor (e.g., lacking relevant repeat dose toxicity data) and/or associated with known exposures and therefore would benefit from data collection or new test data generation (using both NAMs or traditional approaches) to better characterize the category as a whole. The aims of this manuscript are as follows:

1.  Summarize the process of constructing a PFAS landscape;
2.  Profile the PFAS landscape to assign substances into broad structural categories in combination with chain length;
3.  Evaluate the degree of structural similarity within each category and determine which categories needed to be further subset to maximize their structural similarity whilst maintaining a pragmatic total number of categories;
4.  Facilitate the identification of potential candidate PFAS for data collection by capturing additional considerations such as availability of a known manufacturer/importer; Agency and/or State priorities, environmental monitoring information and structural diversity within the category;
5.  Evaluate the categories based on their predicted physical state and physicochemical properties;
6.  Consider the utility of the structural categories developed in performing read-across, as well as refinements such as incorporating mechanistic and toxicokinetic data derived from NAMs. The mechanistic insights derived from EPA's parallel research effort on selected PFAS offer potential opportunities to refine the structurally-based categories developed.

## Methods

### Defining the PFAS landscape of interest {#sec-defining-pfas}

To define the PFAS landscape for the purpose of this study, the starting point was to search the DSSTox database [@grulke_epas_2019; @williams_comptox_2017] using a series of structure-based queries that reflected the PFAS definition described in the TSCA Inactive Significant New Use Rule (SNUR) [@epa_2023]. DSSTox forms the basis of the EPA CompTox Chemicals Dashboard (referred to herein as the Dashboard) [@grulke_epas_2019; @williams_comptox_2017] and comprises 1,200,059 substances (at the time of writing, March 2023). (https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/). As a result of the search, 12,456 substances were identified as forming the initial PFAS landscape for this study. This set was cross referenced with the TSCA inventory (see @sec-lists) to identify matches. For each of the TSCA PFAS, degradation products were simulated using the biodegradation model, Catalogic 301C v13.18 within the commercial software tool, OASIS Catalogic v5.16.1.10 (University As Zlatarov, Laboratory of Mathematical Chemistry, Bourgas, Bulgaria; http://oasis-lmc.org/). The intent was to enrich the landscape for PFAS likely found in the environment that originated from substances in commerce. The set of PFAS degradation products (2959) for the parent TSCA substances were added to the initial landscape such that the final PFAS landscape used in this study comprised 15,415 substances. Note only degradation products meeting the SNUR definition were considered. Chemicals were represented by unique DSSTox Substance Identifiers (DTXSID) [@grulke_epas_2019], Simplified Molecular-Input-Line-Entry System (SMILES) (https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html), chemical names and CAS Registry Numbers (CASRN). International Chemical Identifier keys (InChIKeys), (hashed InChI) [@heller_inchi_2015] were used as identifiers for the degradation products. Chemical substances in the DSSTox database have been curated and standardized to ensure correctness in chemical structure as well as their associations to chemical names and other identifiers such as CASRN. Examples of this curation include checking for errors and mismatches in chemical structure formats and mapping to identifiers, as well as structure validation issues like hyper-valency, tautomerism, etc [@grulke_epas_2019].

### Biodegradation potential

Biodegradation predictions were made for PFAS in the landscape that were on the TSCA inventory using the Catalogic 301C v13.18 model within the commercial software tool, OASIS Catalogic v5.16.1.10. The biodegradation Catalogic 301C model simulates aerobic biodegradation under Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Japan (MITI) I (OECD 301C) test conditions. The modelled endpoint is the percentage of theoretical biological oxygen demand (BOD) on day 28. The underlying training set for the model comprises BOD data for 2618 substances -- 745 of these were collected from the MITI I database and 804 were provided by National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NITE), Japan. A further 1069 substances that were proprietary were provided by NITE, Japan. The training set includes 797 readily biodegradable and 1821 not readily biodegradable substances. In addition to BOD data, a second database underpinning the model comprised pathways for 845 organic substances, documented pathways for 649 chemicals were collected from the primary and secondary literature whereas pathways for 196 proprietary substances were provided by NITE, Japan. In brief, the Catalogic model comprises a metabolic simulator and an endpoint model. The microbial metabolism is simulated by a rule-based approach based on a set of hierarchically ordered transformations and a system of rules controlling the application of these transformations. Recursive application of the transformations allows for the simulation of metabolism and generation of biodegradation pathways. Calculation of the modelled endpoint is based on the simulated metabolic tree and the material balance of transformations used to build the tree. Predictions were made for all PFAS in the landscape that were on the non-confidential TSCA inventory (see @sec-lists for more details). Prediction results containing the list of simulated metabolites (as SMILES) along with their parent DTXSID identifiers were exported as a text file. Prediction results were then processed in the following manner:

1.  DTXSID identifiers were extracted for each parent substance and mapped to each metabolite. This ensured for a given parent, all metabolites could be readily associated with its corresponding parent substance.
2.  A new identifier was then created for the metabolites based on the parent DTXSID identifier. That is to say, the first listed metabolite simulated for parent DTXSID9065256 would be tagged as DTXSID9065256_m_1 and so on.
3.  SMILES that were generated by OASIS software are non-standard in their format and not readable by other cheminformatics software. This was a major limitation as without standardization, no further computation whether that be assigning metabolites to OECD categories or calculating any properties was possible. Using a series of manual *ad hoc* rules, the SMILES generated by the OASIS Catalogic software were converted to a standardized form. This involved transforming stereochemistry annotations and salt form (cation and anion) representations.
4.  InChIKeys were then generated for all standardized SMILES, parents and simulated metabolites. Use of InChIKeys provided an unambiguous means of structurally representing the substance (rather than using SMILES that are potentially non-unique) and enabled subsequent associations to be derived between substances. The processed results were saved for subsequent analysis.

Many degradation products were found to be common across parent substances. Grouping by InChIKeys created a set of unique degradation products. These were filtered to remove non PFAS degradation products leaving a set of 2959 degradation products that were added to the starting landscape of 12,456 substances.

To explore the coverage and relevance of the MITI training set (within the non-proprietary portion) within the Catalogic 301C model relative to the PFAS on the TSCA inventory substances, a comparison was performed to assess the overlap in structural space as characterized by Morgan chemical fingerprints [@rogers_extended-connectivity_2010] (see @sec-fingerprints for details on chemical fingerprint generation). In the latter case, this structural space was projected onto a 2-dimensional (2D) scatterplot (see @fig-miti) using a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to facilitate visualization [@van_er_maaten_visualizing_2018]. The Catalogic model also provided an indication of whether any of the PFAS substances profiled were part of the training set as well as whether they were within the structural domain.

### Profiling PFAS into structural categories

The conceptual workflow for creating the PFAS structural categories is summarized in @fig-categorisation.

![Conceptual workflow for generating PFAS structural categories](PFAS_categorisation.png){#fig-categorisation width="100%"}

#### Primary structural categories {#sec-primary-categories}

This study aimed to develop a hierarchy of PFAS categories starting with a handful of large, diverse categories that could be subcategorized into more structurally similar categories based on other considerations (e.g., chemical fingerprints, chain length). To that end, primary categories were derived by profiling the PFAS landscape of 15,415 substances through the database framework developed by Su and Rajan [@su_database_2021] called "PFAS-Map" (https://github.com/MatInfoUB/PFAS_Map_MaDE_UB). As described in Su and Rajan [@su_database_2021], PFAS could be classified into one of at least nine broad primary categories:

-   PFAS derivatives
-   PFAAs
-   PFAA precursors
-   Non-PFAA perfluoroalkyls
-   FASA-based PFAA precursors
-   Fluorotelomer-based PFAA precursors
-   Silicon PFAS
-   Side-chain fluorinated aromatics PFAS
-   Other aliphatic PFAS

PFAAs makes reference to perfluoroalkyl acids whereas FASA denotes perfluoroalkane sulfonamides. The PFAS landscape was also processed through the OPEn structure-activity/property Relationship App (OPERA) v2.9 tool [@mansouri_opera_2018] (https://github.com/kmansouri/OPERA) to derive QSAR READY SMILES and selected physicochemical property predictions (as discussed in Section @sec-physchem). These are standardized SMILES where salts and stereochemistry are removed. QSAR READY SMILES could be generated for 15,093 substances (out of 15,415) of the PFAS landscape. Substances without QSAR READY SMILES or which could not be computationally resolved were assigned as "Unclassified". In practice, when substances are batch processed by PFAS-Map, a first class and second-class classification are designated. For this study, the first-class designation was used as the initial primary category assignment which was then converted using a simple mapping dictionary to ensure that substances such as "Fluorotelomer PFAA precursors, cyclic" were aggregated to "Fluorotelomer PFAA precursors". This was performed to limit the number of primary structural categories which themselves were largely consistent with the hierarchy described by OECD in their Terminology 2021 guidance [@oecd_reconciling_2021]. This is reflected in step 2 of the workflow in @fig-categorisation.

#### Secondary structural categories

It is hypothesized that the length of carbon chain influences differences in toxicity and the length of time the chemical spends in the body and environment. This supposition has been underpinned by experiences with PFAAs [@chambers_review_2021; @sznajder-katarzynska_review_2019]. Due to the potential importance of chain length in the toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation of PFAS, secondary structural categories were defined using a carbon chain length threshold.

*Chain length determination*

The maximum number of contiguous CF2 groups in a chain was determined for all 15,415 substances. This was achieved by iterating through a range of CF2 chain lengths and determining the longest chain length where there was a match with the corresponding substance. For instance, Perfluorosebacamidine \[DTXSID40380015\] contains 8 contiguous CF2 units; hence, its chain length was denoted as 8. PFOA had a maximum chain length of 7 whereas PFOS had a maximum chain length of 8. For PFOA, although there are 8 carbons in its backbone, the 8th is part of the carboxyl group whereas in PFOS, there are 8 CF2 groups plus the sulfonate group.

For the current analysis, the chain length threshold was set at 7 (\>=7 vs \<7). This threshold served as a pragmatic representation of what constitutes a "long chain" PFAS. The chain length threshold is broadly consistent with the EPA's 2009 PFAS action plan (https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-01/documents/pfcs_action_plan1230_09.pdf). A PFAS with a maximum CF2 number greater than or equal to 7 was denoted "gte7". Using this threshold, both PFOS and PFOA would be assigned to the "gte7" secondary category. A PFAS with a maximum number of CF2 groups less than 7 was denoted "lt7". Defining chain lengths for PFAS with non-contiguous chains or branching is less clear but has been evaluated in more detail by Richard et al [@richard_identification_2022; @richard_new_2023] through the development of new PFAS specific chemical fingerprints, so-named PFAS ToxPrints, as an extension of the logic used to develop the original ToxPrints that had been defined for a broader chemistry [@yang_new_2015].\
A secondary category was thus denoted by its PFAS-Map assignment, akin to the primary OECD structural classification and a carbon chain length threshold e.g., Perfluorooctanesulfonamidoacetic acid \[DTXSID40440941\] would thus be described as belonging to the "FASA based PFAA precursors, gte7" secondary category (see @fig-categorisation).

#### Derivation of Terminal structural categories {#sec-term-cat}

The underlying motivation for the study was to identify categories that would balance maximizing structural similarity that could permit read-across within those categories versus pragmatism in terms of total number of categories. Too many categories with very few substances renders the approach less generalizable, too few categories could result in extrapolating between substances that were not sufficiently similar. To that end, an objective threshold was needed to determine how granular categories needed to be to manage this trade-off and ensure that the categorization was actionable. An objective threshold was developed, described in @sec-objective-threshold, that compared structural similarity within a category relative to the structural similarity between different categories.

### Chemical fingerprints {#sec-fingerprints}

Morgan chemical fingerprints [@rogers_extended-connectivity_2010] were calculated for all substances within each secondary category using the open-source Python library RDkit (Landrum, rdkit.org) with a radius of 3 and a bit-length of 1024. Fingerprints capture presence (denoted by 1) and absence of features (denoted as 0) and hence, by their nature they represent a binary dataset. These fingerprint (FP) files were stored for subsequent processing. Morgan fingerprints also known as Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs) are widely used in machine learning applications for cheminformatics [@oboyle_comparing_2016] especially when ranking diverse structures by similarity. These circular fingerprints map the molecular environment of every atom.

### Chemical similarity {#sec-chem-sim}

Pairwise distance matrices were calculated for each secondary category. These were generated by using the chemical fingerprint files as inputs and computing the Jaccard distance for each pair of substances. The Jaccard distance captures the proportion of FP bits between 2 substances that differ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index). The Jaccard distance ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 would indicate zero distance (or high similarity) and 1 would indicate high distance (or low similarity). Distance matrices were computed for all secondary categories and stored for subsequent processing. These are referred to as 'within category' distance matrices in @sec-objective-threshold.

### Objective distance threshold {#sec-objective-threshold}

The rationale underpinning the objective distance threshold was based on the expectation that the variance in the distribution of the pairwise distances for each secondary category representing the 'within category' similarity would be lower than distributions of the pairwise distances between different secondary categories ('between category'). The 'within category' distances had already been computed as described in @sec-chem-sim.

'Between category' combinations aimed to identify categories that did not share the same primary category root. A list of all possible binary combinations of secondary categories was created using the names of the secondary categories, "Other aliphatics, lt7" and "PFAAs, gte7" is an example of such a binary combination. These were then filtered to remove secondary categories that shared the same primary category root (i.e., a combination such as "PFAAs, lt7" and "PFAAs, gte7" would be excluded from consideration as a 'between category'). Chemical fingerprint datasets for each binary combination were created by joining the secondary category chemical fingerprint datasets together. Pairwise distance matrices were then derived for the combined category set. These were filtered to retain only the pairwise distances between starting secondary categories.

The empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs) of the pairwise distances were calculated for each secondary category (see @fig-ecdfs-within for a plot of the ECDFs). ECDFs were also derived for the 'between category' combinations (see @fig-ecdfs-bet for a plot of the first 10 ECDFs). The ECDFs permitted a visual inspection of the range of the pairwise distances across all secondary categories as well as across all 'between category' combinations. Based on visual inspection of the ECDFs, the median value for each distribution was selected as the summary metric.

Probability density functions of median values from all within and between secondary categories were plotted to explore their overlap. The 5th percentile of the 'between categories' distribution was defined as the threshold to determine whether a secondary category merited further subcategorization. A secondary category was only subcategorized if the median of its 'within category' pairwise distance distribution exceeded this threshold.

### Deriving Terminal categories {#sec-terminal}

Secondary categories that exceeded the threshold were subcategorized using agglomerative hierarchical clustering. The condensed form of the pairwise distance matrix computed for each secondary category that exceeded the threshold was used as an input into a hierarchical clustering using Ward's method [@ward_hierarchical_1963]. Ward's method is a criterion that minimizes the total within-cluster variance. For each secondary category, the dendrogram was plotted and the number of first-generation clusters was set as the maximum cluster number. Clusters were labelled as 1,2,3 etc. Each of the clustering results were combined into one table which was then merged with the starting table of primary and secondary categories.

The next generation of categories, quaternary categories, would then be processed in the same manner to determine whether any exceeded the objective threshold and needed to be subcategorized further as already described. In practice, a maximum of two generations of subcategorizations were performed, with the expectation that this would balance the structural similarity within the category relative to total number of terminal categories.

Secondary categories or tertiary categories which did not exceed the threshold were ultimately denoted as the terminal category. Thus, a terminal category could be tagged as "PFAA, lt7", effectively a secondary category, or could be tagged as "Other aliphatics, lt7, 1", a tertiary category or following two iterations of subcategorization would be tagged as "Other aliphatics, gte7, 1, 2" (see @fig-categorisation). Note: in the data files and figures, terminal categories without one or two iterations of subcategorization are denoted as "PFAA, lt7, nan, nan" or "Other aliphatics, lt7, 1, nan" where "nan" represents a null value.

### Identification of Centroid Substances {#sec-centroid}

For each terminal category, a single substance was identified that was nominally representative of the category. This substance was the computed centroid calculated from the Jaccard pairwise distance matrices (see @sec-chem-sim). The sum of the pairwise distances across all substances for a given structural category was computed and the substance with the minimum value was denoted as the centroid (i.e., this substance would have the lowest distance from all other category members). Technically, this calculation gives rise to the medoid of a cluster. However, for the purposes of this analysis, the term centroid is used for convenience to denote it as the 'central' substance within the category. Distances of all category members relative to the centroid substance were also computed.

### Identification of Additional Representative Substances {#sec-maxmin}

Since many of the terminal categories were likely to be large in size, a single substance might be insufficient to both characterize the category and its potential hazard profile. To address this limitation, the MaxMinPicker approach, as implemented within the RDKit Python library, was applied to identify additional substances which would in turn capture the breadth and diversity of each terminal category [@ashton_identification_2002]. The MaxMinPicker approach proceeds as follows:

1\. Molecular descriptors are generated for all substances. In this case, the Morgan fingerprints calculated for all substances within a terminal category represented the candidate pool whereas the pre-computed centroid equated to the initial seed.

2\. From the substances in the terminal category, the substance that had the maximum value for its minimum distance to the picked set (initially this would be just the centroid) would then be identified. This substance would be the most distant one to those already picked so it would be transferred to the 'picked set' (now centroid + 1).

3\. An iteration back to step 2 would then be performed until the desired number of substances were picked.

The MaxMin approach is a well-established algorithm for dissimilarity-based compound selection that has been applied in drug discovery for many years. The reader is referred to Snarey et al [@snarey_comparison_1997] for a comparison of the different algorithms.

The MaxMinPicker was applied to all terminal categories containing more than 5 members to identify the next 3 most diverse substances within a category (centroid + up to 3 additional substances). The intention of identifying additional diverse substances was to help bound the domain of the structural category. The identification of 3 most diverse substances was chosen out of convenience to provide an actionable number of additional substances.

A systematic evaluation of the relationship between the number of diverse substances that could be identified relative to the structural diversity within each terminal category was also undertaken. This was approached as follows, first the ranked order by diversity of all members within a terminal category was computed. Then the pairwise distance matrices derived in @sec-chem-sim were filtered by the diverse substances, starting from the centroid, centroid plus first diverse chemical through to the complete set of category members. At each step the mean minimum distance was recorded. This enabled the construction of a matrix to capture the mean of the minimum pairwise distances relative to the number of diverse chemicals selected. The normalized cumulative sum of all the mean minimum distances was then computed. This provided a means of evaluating the proportion of structural diversity that was captured as a function of the number of MaxMin substances identified.

Two aspects could be assessed objectively from this calculation, namely:

1\. how much structural diversity was being captured by the 3 diverse picks originally identified; and

2\. how many diverse substances should ideally be ientified (if practical resources were not a limiting factor) that would capture a specified level of the structural diversity. For example, how many substances would need to be identified if capturing a specific percentage of the structural diversity within a terminal category was desired, 80% is presented here merely for illustrative purposes.

### Facilitating the identification for potential candidates for data collection

To facilitate the identification of potential candidate PFAS for data collection, availability of a known manufacturer/importer, Agency and/or State priorities, environmental monitoring information were evaluated as additional considerations. These are described in turn.

#### Qualitative exposure and release designations {#sec-lists}

Several qualitative designations were added to the landscape to identify substances based on their TSCA inventory status, Chemical Data Reporting under TSCA, State/EPA Region priorities, as well as physical state and physicochemical properties.

The non-confidential (Non-CBI) TSCA Inventory active and inactive lists were downloaded from the Dashboard and combined into one large set. Substances within this inventory are annotated by Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) Registry Number, Chemical Abstracts (CA) Index Name, and DSSTox substance identifier (DTXSID). These were matched by the DTXSID identifiers already captured in the PFAS landscape. Substances were tagged as 'inactive', 'active' or 'unclassified'. Note the predicted degradation products of substances tagged as either "inactive" or "active" had been used to augment the PFAS landscape as already described in @sec-defining-pfas.

The CDR data from 2020 was downloaded from the public EPA web address (https://www.epa.gov/chemical-data-reporting/access-cdr-data). The data is structured in several files depending on the granularity of information captured. The CDR data comprises information for a set of 8660 substances. DTXSID identifiers were available for 8017 of these substances when using the Batch search functionality within the Dashboard. A tag was created for CDR2020 status if a PFAS was found to be associated with a CDR record. National Aggregated Production Volume (National Agg PV) data was also extracted to highlight how this was distributed across primary categories. Since some of the production volume (PV) data was numeric and some represented in numeric ranges, the PV data was summarized into one of 10 different ranges (\<25,000 lbs, 25-\<100,000 lbs, 100,000 \<500,000 lbs, 500,000 -\<1,000,000 lbs, 50,000,000 -\<100,000,000 lbs, \<1,000,000 lbs, 100,000,000 -\< 1,000,000,000 lbs, 20,000,000 -\< 100,000,000 lbs, 1,000,000 -\< 20,000,000 lbs, 1,000,000 -\<10,000,000 lbs).\

Various EPA Regions or States have identified PFAS of interest based on validated analytical methods or for environmental monitoring purposes. The data sources captured as part of the EPA's PFAS Analytic Tools website (https://echo.epa.gov/trends/pfas-tools#data) were used to construct lists of such PFAS. The specific data sources were Discharge Monitoring Data, Drinking Water (State) Data, Drinking Water (Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR)) Data, Environmental Media Data, Production Data, Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Data -- Waste Managed, TRI Data -- On-Site, TRI Data -- Off-Site and Production Data (all accessed 7th April 2023). Discharge Monitoring data is collected by virtue of the National Pollutant Elimination System permit. Drinking Water Data comprises UCMR and State level monitoring data. Environmental Media data comprises ambient sampling data reported by federal, state, tribal and local governments, academic and non-governmental organizations, and individuals that are submitted to the Water Quality Portal (WQP). Production data entails information reported under the Chemical Data Reporting (CDR) Rule under TSCA. TRI tracks the management of certain toxic chemicals that may pose a threat to human health or the environment by more than 21,000 facilities throughout the US and its territories. The National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal year 2020 (NDAA) added certain PFAS to the TRI list and provided a framework for the ongoing listing of additional PFAS.

Identifiers were extracted from these source files and searched against the Dashboard to map to DTXSID records. The set of identifiers (Names and CASRN) within the entire PFAS landscape were also queried against PubMed, the National Library of Medicine's citation index for biomedical literature, to determine whether a substance might have been studied in the literature. The number of citations were obtained using the same queries as in Abstract Sifter v7.5 [@baker_abstract_2017].

The route of exposure and presence in environmental media are dependent on the physical state and physicochemical properties. Physicochemical properties were predicted using the open-source OPERA v2.9 tool [@mansouri_opera_2018] for all substances with QSAR READY SMILES. Predictions were possible for 15,093 substances in the PFAS landscape (as discussed in @sec-primary-categories). Properties predicted were melting point, boiling point, Henry's Law constant, water solubility and vapour pressure. For the physical state, a melting point less than 25 deg C would be indicative of a liquid whereas a value greater would be a solid and a boiling point less than 25 deg C would be a gas. These are the guiding principles underpinning the EPA's Sustainable Futures Framework guidance (see https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-05/documents/05-iad_discretes_june2013.pdf). A water solubility threshold of 100 mg/L was used to denote whether a substance was soluble/insoluble whereas a vapour pressure threshold of 75 mmHg or a HLC of 0.1 atm m3 mol-1 determined volatility. Based on these properties, each substance was assigned into 1 of 4 'physical state and physicochemical designations' (from A-D). Designation A aimed to capture substances that were insoluble solids, B to identify both soluble solids and soluble non-volatile liquids, whereas C tagged soluble volatile liquids/insoluble liquids and soluble gases. Designation D assigned substances as insoluble gases or highly volatile gases. Substances that could not be assigned into one of these 4 designations was tagged as 'not determined'. For each of the terminal structural categories, Morgan fingerprint representations were projected into two dimensions using a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to facilitate visualization [@van_er_maaten_visualizing_2018]. The projections were plotted as 2D kernel density distributions overlaid with physical state and physicochemical designation information to help explore the extent to which members were assigned to the same designation and therefore had a consistent profile across a given terminal category.

Each of these respective qualitative designations were then matched to the PFAS landscape to provide another attribute for consideration when identifying potential candidates for data collection.

### Constrained PFAS Landscape {#sec-constrained}

One of the limitations of the identification of centroids and additional diverse substances was that they might yet not yield feasible candidates for data collection due to the lack of assignable manufacturer/importer. This was articulated as a potential challenge in the National PFAS Testing Strategy. To address this practical constraint, the same process of computing centroids, identifying additional diverse substances and evaluating their structural diversity coverage was also performed using the terminal categories as a basis as described in @sec-terminal but constraining the landscape to only those substances on the TSCA inventory and specifically those substances that were actives on the TSCA inventory. Constraining the landscape would allow identification of substances for data collection that were already in commerce and/or could be more readily procured.

### Evaluation of variance of *in vivo* toxicity within terminal categories {#sec-invivo}

Ultimately, read-across of data within categories could be performed such that the hazard profile of the category is adequate without needing to test a significant number of category members. To evaluate the feasibility of performing read-across within the terminal categories derived, an exploration of the distribution of *in vivo* points of departure (PODs) within and across terminal categories was performed for 2 routes of exposure; oral and inhalation.

#### Variance of *in vivo* PODs across and within terminal categories {#sec-rax}

From ToxValDB version 9.4, the Toxicity Values Database (Judson et al., *in prep*), all studies where 'oral' or 'inhalation' was the route of exposure were extracted. Only records where a point of departure was reported as a NOEL, NOAEL, NOAEC, LOAEL, LOEL, LOAEC and where the dose units were expressed as mg/kg-bw/day or mg/m3 were retrieved. Study types were also restricted to the following: 'short-term', 'subchronic', 'chronic', 'developmental', 'reproduction', 'reproduction developmental', 'neurotoxicity', 'carcinogenicity', 'chronic cancer', 'developmental neurotoxicity','neurotoxicity short-term', 'neurotoxicity subchronic','neurotoxicity chronic', 'repeat dose other' and 'immunotoxicity' as captured in the 'study type' field within the database. The toxicity data extracted for each route of exposure was then merged with the PFAS substances from the landscape. The minimum study-level point of departure (POD) was then taken. Aggregating all minimum values to a single value per substance depended on the availability of NOAEL(C)-type or LOAEL(C)-type data and was performed as follows. Minimum NOEL(C)/NOAEL(C) values were preferentially used for a substance but if these were not available, LOEL(C)/LOAEL(C) values were taken and adjusted by a factor of 10. The 10th percentile of all values was then reported for a substance irrespective of its study type or duration. Whilst the approach of aggregating the available information across study types and durations is a simplified assumption, the summary value provides an estimate of the POD for each substance and the expected level of variation across and within categories. Box and whisker plots were created to reflect the distribution of the PODs across the terminal categories for each route of exposure. Strip plots were overlaid to show the variation of chain length across a given terminal category for the oral route of exposure.

### Qualitative mechanistic and toxicokinetic designations {#sec-nam-flag}

A summary of the NAM testing being undertaken for \~150 PFAS was described in Patlewicz et al. [@patlewicz_towards_2022]. See Houck et al. [@houck_bioactivity_2021] for results from various nuclear receptor and oxidative stress targeted assays, Houck et al. [@houck_evaluation_2023] for 12 human primary cell-based assay models of pathophysiology including immunosuppression, Carstens et al. [@carstens_evaluation_2023] for the developmental neurotoxicity assays, and, for toxicokinetic information, Smeltz et al. [@smeltz_plasma_2023] and Kreutz et al. [@kreutz_category-based_2023]. Manuscripts describing the remaining data streams (zebrafish developmental toxicity and thyroid pathway assays) are in preparation.

In addition to the NAM testing, a quality control (QC) evaluation of the chemical stock solutions was undertaken to confirm PFAS analyte presence and stability [@smeltz_targeted_2023]. This evaluation was warranted given recent reports of certain PFAS degrading in the aprotic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), readily used as the solvent of choice in HTS [@liberatore_solvent_2020; @zhang_stability_2022]. Two hundred and five PFAS selected based on criteria described in Patlewicz et al. [@patlewicz_towards_2022] were evaluated using low resolution tandem mass spectrometric detection strategies to confirm presence of intended analyte, evaluate analyte stability and presence of isomers, and verify stock concentrations for a subset for which commercially available verified standards were available. Ultimately 57 PFAS failed QC evaluation, with three exhibiting degradation in DMSO and the remainder not detected as present, likely due to volatilization. The pass/fail scores and informational flags as described in Smeltz et al. [@smeltz_targeted_2023], and can be downloaded from https://epa.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Chemistry_Dashboard_Data_Analytical_QC_for_PFAS/22118099.

For each of the NAM data streams, substances were tagged with a qualitative flag to indicate the class of mechanistic information that could be derived from the associated assay outcome (e.g., estrogen receptor activity from a nuclear receptor assay) and an expert-derived qualitative level of confidence associated with the outcome (high, medium or low). Only NAM results from substances that passed QC were carried forward. These flags were considered as an additional line of evidence to determine whether a terminal category might merit being split based on its mechanistic or toxicokinetic information or to inform what types of higher order testing might be most impactful for a given substance drawn from said terminal category. The derivation of the flags are described in more detail in Judson et al. *in prep*. Confidence scores across the NAM flags were standardized as appropriate to facilitate visualizations across data streams. Each flag could take on one of three values, low, medium and high confidence, color coded as blue, yellow and red. The flag categories are summarized below in @tbl-nams.

: Summary of NAM Flag Rationales {#tbl-nams tbl-colwidths=\[10,30,30,30\]}

Qualitative observations of the consistency of the various flags across all the tested substances and within terminal categories were made. The Fisher‛s exact test was used to compute an odds ratio and associated p value for each PFAS ToxPrint relative to NAM flag that had been converted into a binary scale. This analysis to look for enrichments was comparable with the methodology discussed in Wang et al.[@wang_high-throughput_2019]. A PFAS ToxPrint was considered enriched if it had an odds ratio greater than or equal to 3, and an one-sided Fishers exact p-value less than 0.05 (probability value of the odds ratio being greater than 1). The set of 'enriched' PFAS ToxPrints were then used to profile the entire Landscape to assign potential predicted NAM flags. Comparisons were made of the actual NAM flags and their predictions to evaluate performance metrics (sensitivity and specificity).

## Data analysis software and code {#sec-code}

## Results and discussion

### Primary and secondary structural categories

The PFAS landscape following application of the TSCA SNUR rule to DSSTox resulted in a dataset comprising 12,456 substances plus 2959 degradation products for a total of 15,415.

Minimal structural overlap was found between the 1549 accessible training set substances (of which 1429 substances could be resolved into structures) from the Catalogic model and the TSCA inventory substances. @fig-miti depicts a t-SNE plot for the MITI training set substances relative to the TSCA substances using Morgan chemical fingerprints as inputs. There were 17 TSCA substances of the dataset that were part of the training set. Only 30% of the PFAS TSCA substances were tagged as being within the structural domain of the model. In view of this, the degradation products simulated (comprising 19% of the landscape) should be interpreted with caution until additional experimental data are collected and new models developed.

A chain length could not be computed for one substance: DTXSID301146476 as shown in @tbl-dropped since RDKit could not resolve the SMILES. This substance was dropped from further consideration. Thus, the final PFAS landscape used for the remainder of the analysis comprised 15,414 substances.

From @fig-secondary-cats, there appear to be no substances assigned as "Unable to open ring(s)". In fact there were 2 substances that were tagged as "Unable to open ring(s)" which included heterocyclic moieties comprising a hydrazine linkage and a disulphide bond (see @tbl-ring).

: 'Unable to open ring(s)' substances. {#tbl-ring}

Across the more than 15,000 PFAS substances evaluated, forty-one percent of the substances fell into the "Other aliphatics, lt7" category. In addition, 786 substances fell into the "Unclassified, lt7" or "Unclassified, gte7" secondary categories. This represents a potential limitation of using broad definitions represented by the OECD primary categories themselves. A chemotype ToxPrint enrichment was explored following the approach outlined in Wang et al.[@wang_high-throughput_2019] but using the PFAS specific ToxPrints developed in Richard et al [@richard_new_2023] (see @sec-supp for methodological details). This was an effort to identify whether there were specific structural features that might be helpful in splitting apart those primary categories with the largest memberships namely (i.e., "Other aliphatics" and "Unclassified"). The most enriched features for the "Unclassified" category included fluorotelomer chains and phosphorus or sulfonic acid functional groups whereas heteroatoms, nitriles, amines and epoxides featured as functional groups for the "Other aliphatics". However, these enriched features were not determined to be sufficiently distinctive to justify creation of additional primary categories.

Structural similarity was evaluated within and between secondary categories to determine which secondary categories required further subcategorization (as discussed in @sec-objective-threshold of the Methods). @fig-threshold shows the two distributions of the median pairwise distance distributions in the between and within secondary category combinations. The objective distance threshold derived by taking the 5th percentile of the median pairwise distances from the between categories combinations resulted in a value of 0.75.

![Probability density functions of the median Jaccard pairwise distance distributions for within (orange) and between (blue) secondary categories. Orange and blue graphed lines represent the fits to the probability density distributions.](Figure2_061123.png){#fig-threshold width="50%"}

Based on the threshold, 13 secondary categories (@tbl-require-cat) were found to exceed the value that would render them subject to further subcategorization. The thirteen secondary categories included the "Other aliphatics", "Side-chain aromatics", "Silicon PFAS", "Unclassified", "PFAA precursors" and "Non-PFAA perfluoroalkyls". The "Other aliphatics" categories are of little surprise given their membership sizes were the largest out of all the secondary combinations; hence, these categories were expected to be the most diverse in terms of their structural makeup. Since the "Unable to open ring(s)" category only comprised 5 substances in total (as shown in @tbl-ring), this category was excluded from any subcategorization.

Following creation of the next generation categories, there were 19 tertiary categories that met or exceeded the threshold and were subcategorized further. The root primary categories were predominantly from the "Other aliphatics", "Side-chain aromatics", "Fluorotelomer PFAA precursor" and "Non-PFAA perfluoroalkyls" categories. @fig-quartcat reflects the quaternary categories for the 19 that were subset further.

Terminal categories were defined as either secondary or tertiary categories that did not exceed the threshold, as well as all quaternary categories. A total of 90 terminal categories were ultimately derived. This represented a trade-off in terms of the final number of terminal categories that was a practical number to characterize the landscape of PFAS balanced with maximizing structural similarity within the categories themselves. The full list of 15,414 substances together with their terminal category assignments are provided in the supplementary information. Structural similarity within categories did increase following subcategorization, @fig-ecdfs-left shows the ECDFs of several terminal categories which are left shifted relative to the original ECDFs for the secondary categories (@fig-ecdfs-within), i.e. the pairwise distance range decreases.

### Selection of representative substances {#sec-maxmin-all}

Whilst centroids were selected as the most representative substance from each terminal category, there was a recognition that a single chemical was unlikely to capture the breadth of diversity within a category. Additional substances to capture the breadth and structural diversity relied on the MaxMinPicker method. This method was used to select up to 3 further substances in addition to the centroid. A total of 344 substances were selected using this approach for 86 of the terminal categories. Terminal categories with 5 or fewer members did not result in any additional substances being selected (beyond the centroid) by the approach. @tbl-maxmin-cat lists the 4 terminal categories which had insufficient membership to apply the MaxMinPicker approach.

| Terminal category           | Membership |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| PFAA precursors, lt7, 1, 2  | 4          |

: Terminal categories for which the MaxMin approach was not undertaken. {#tbl-maxmin-cat}

To evaluate the proportion of structural diversity captured by the selected representative substances, the normalized cumulative minimum distance was calculated as a function of the number of substances selected using the MaxMinPicker method as discussed in @sec-maxmin . There were 12 terminal categories, out of the 86 terminal categories for which diverse substances were selected, where picking 3 substances captured at least 50% of the structural diversity (shown in @tbl-structdiversity-all).

: Terminal categories for which 3 representative substance selections capture more than 50% of the structural diversity. {#tbl-structdiversity-all}

Notes: Column 1 represents the number of substances that would be required to capture 80% of the structural diversity in the category, Cumulative % of Structural Diversity represents the normalized cumulative minimum distance for up to 3 selected diverse substances. Note the 80% used as a threshold is purely for demonstration purposes only.

For the largest terminal category, "Other aliphatics, lt7, 3,4", the existing up to 3 diverse substances only captures 0.38% of the structural diversity. In order to capture 80% of the structural diversity for this terminal category, 1149 substances would need to be selected for data collection. The number of substances to select from each terminal category to capture 80% of the structural diversity varied from 1 (as shown above in @tbl-structdiversity-all) to 1149 with the median number being 21.

@fig-structdiv shows the curves of the number of diverse selections as a function of the percentage normalized cumulative minimum distances for 10 terminal categories. These vary in steepness showing how quickly or not the structural diversity coverage converges with number of diverse selections depending on the terminal category of interest. @fig-structdiv-hm highlights the difference in the number of diverse chemicals that would be needed to capture a minimum structural diversity across each terminal category. 

![For a selection of terminal categories, the extent to which the fraction of structural diversity is captured relative to number of diverse chemicals selected varies.](Figure1_structural_diversity_061123.png){#fig-structdiv}

![Heatmap showing the number of diverse substances that would need to be selected to achieve a specific minimum % structural diversity coverage across each terminal category.](structural_diversity_hm_261123.png.png){#fig-structdiv-hm}

@fig-structdiv-corr attempts to summarize the tradeoff of the number of diverse chemicals (centroids and MaxMin) as a function of % structural diversity captured across the terminal categories. 

![Lineplot showing the number of diverse substances that would need to be selected to achieve a specific minimum % structural diversity coverage across the terminal categories.](Terminal_categorisation_unconstrained_landscape.png){#fig-structdiv-corr}

The diverse selections identified earlier for the terminal categories reflects a pragmatism in terms of identifying a potential candidate list of substances. As discussed in later @sec-tsca, the structural diversity captured forms one of the considerations in selecting candidates for additional data collection relative to those terminal categories that are data poor or contain substances that are on the TSCA inventory.

### Evaluation of physical state and physicochemical consistency within terminal categories {#sec-physchem}

In order to determine the nature of further data collection activities and understanding the potential presence in different environmental media, physical state and physicochemical information was determined for PFAS landscape as far as possible. For the 15,414 substances in the PFAS landscape, 322 substances (2.1%) could not be assigned into any specific physical state and physicochemical designation owing to a lack of predicted physicochemical property information, 133 substances (0.8%) were assigned into designation D, designations B and C were relatively evenly distributed (range: 4054-4230, 26-27%). Designation A was the most assigned - 6675 substances (43%). The proportions differed if only substances on the TSCA active inventory were considered namely designation A (27%), designation B (23%), designation C (41%), designation D (7.5%) and no designation (2%). Across the terminal categories, there was a general trend of number of designations increasing with size in category membership (see @fig-cat-mem). @fig-tsne-physchem shows an example of one of the most diverse and largest terminal categories "Other aliphatics, lt7, 3, 2" which comprises 779 members and spans all 4 designations. Although substances predominantly lie within designation C, there is no discernible separation between the designations across the structural category as characterized by Morgan fingerprints. In contrast all 106 substances belonging to terminal category "FASA based PFAA precursors, gte7, nan, nan" fell into designation A (figure not shown) whereas the 44 substances in "PFAA precursors', 'gte7', nan, nan" fell into designations C and D. There was a positive association between how structurally diverse a terminal category was and the consistency in physical state and physicochemical profile observed (as reflected by the designations). However, the Morgan fingerprints could not resolve the differences. For the selection of potential candidates for data collection, the physical state and physicochemical profile remains an important consideration in concert with the structural diversity described in @sec-maxmin-all.

### Variation of POD values across and within terminal categories

Ultimately, the terminal categories are intended to facilitate a read-across. To explore the feasibility of this further, the 10th percentile values of minimum oral and inhalation study level PODs were derived using available data for 77 substances and 28 substances, respectively. The distributions were plotted in a series of box plots. *In vivo* toxicity data were available for at least one chemical in 31 of the 90 terminal categories across the two routes of exposure (30 for oral, 14 for inhalation). The available data allowed preliminary trends for terminal categories to be observed where the primary root was FASA based PFAA precursors, PFAAs, Fluorotelomer PFAA precursors, and some of the Other aliphatics categories. In @fig-pods-all, boxplots for each of the routes of exposure are shown side by side, though there were only 14 terminal categories ("Fluorotelomer PFAA precursors, lt7, 2, 1", "Fluorotelomer PFAA precursors, lt7, 2, 3", "Fluorotelomer PFAA precursors, lt7, 3, 3", "Non-PFAA perfluoroalkyls, lt7, 1,3", "Non-PFAA perfluoroalkyls, lt7, 2,1", "Non-PFAA perfluoroalkyls, lt7, 2,3", "Other aliphatics, lt7, 1, 1", "Other aliphatics, lt7, 1, 4", "Other aliphatics, lt7, 2, 4", "Other aliphatics, lt7, 3, 2", "Other aliphatics, lt7, 3, 4", "PFAA precursors, lt7, 2, nan", "PFAAs, gte7, nan, nan", "PFAS derivatives, lt7, 2, 3") for which inhalation data was available. Inspection of the plots was intended to facilitate a coarse grain evaluation of the extent of the variation in PODs as a function of chain length and category. PODs were plotted on a log scale.

![Boxplots of the variation of 10th percentiles of minimum point of departure values from oral and inhalation studies (units mg/kg/day, mg/m3 respectively). The box in the boxplot reflects the quartiles of the dataset, whilst the whiskers extend to + 1.5 \* inter-quartile range (IQR). Outliers are shown as points if they exceed 1.5 \* IQR. The inhalation boxplot is shown [below]{.underline} the oral boxplot for a given terminal category.](Figure11_inhalation_oral_PODs_261123.png.png){#fig-pods-all}

@fig-pods-oral shows boxplot and strip plots for the oral studies only. It appears that substances at each end of the spectrum of chain length within a category tended to exhibit lower toxicity, i.e., their aggregate POD is higher. The spread of POD values within a category with greater diversity in chain length tend to span \> 2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, of the 77 substances with studies, 34 were associated with NOEL/NOAEL values only or a combination of NOEL/NOAEL/LOEL/LOAEL values.

![Boxplots showing the spread of the 10th percentile of the minimum oral POD values across and within terminal categories bounded by the carbon chain number. The box in the boxplot reflects the quartiles of the dataset, whilst the whiskers extend to + 1.5 \* inter-quartile range (IQR). Outliers are shown as points if they exceed 1.5 \* IQR.](ch7_POD_S1_oral_261123.png){#fig-pods-oral}

Although the available toxicity data are limited, there does appear to be some separation in the potency distributions between terminal categories based on a common primary root. Inspection of @fig-pods-oral does show a shift in potency values between the two FASA based PFAA precursors categories with those in the gte7 category being more potent. Similarly, there is a general shift between the PFAA categories with a left shift for those substances in the gte7 category vs the majority of the PFAA lt7 categories. On the otherhand, the Fluorotelomer PFAA precursors did not reflect a shift between the gte7 and lt7 categories, possibly since the toxicity data were clustered within a fairly narrow range of chain lengths. However, the relatively large spread for some of the terminal categories suggests that additional refinement beyond structural similarity and chain length will likely be needed for some terminal categories prior to broader application in a read-across context.

### Qualitative Mechanistic and Toxicokinetic designations

There were six data streams with qualitative flags assigned for the \~150 PFAS tested as part of the research project described in Patlewicz et al [@patlewicz_towards_2022] namely: 1) nuclear receptor assays (NR); 2) developmental toxicity (zebrafish testing); 3) DNT (developmental neurotoxicity); 4) thyroid toxicity; 5) immunosuppression (BioMAP assays); and 6) toxicokinetics (TK). No data were represented as null values (white colored), data available but no flag identified as denoted a 0 (blue colored), 1 denoted a medium confidence flag (yellow colored) and 2 was associated with a high confidence flag (colored in red) consistent with the descriptions described in @tbl-nams. 

A semi quantitative analysis was performed by computing which PFAS ToxPrints were enriched for each NAM flag. The full set of enriched ToxPrints are provided in the supplementary information. Those enriched PFAS ToxPrints were then used to profile the entire landscape to provide a predicted NAM flag profile. Performance metrics were derived to compare the actual and predicted NAM flag (see @tbl-metrics). Performance appeared weakest for the DNT and Immune flags which had the fewest number of ToxPrints that were enriched. It is worth noting that only ~150 chemicals (of which 124 substances overlapped with the PFAS landscape) were tested and the performance of these ToxPrint signatures may changed as more substances are tested.

### Potential application to support the National PFAS Testing Strategy (NTS) {#sec-tsca}

There are several considerations that come into play when identifying potential candidates for data collection in concert with the landscape defined. To make the NTS actionable, one consideration was to limit the landscape to one that was constrained by the TSCA active inventory to increase the feasibility of being able to identify a manufacturer/importer of the substance. A second enables the tradeoff between the number of diverse substances to select vs capturing the structural diversity to be more practically addressed. Herein, the scope of terminal categories represented by the TSCA and TSCA active inventory and the impact this has in terms of capturing structural diversity was evaluated. Finally, a proposal was outlined that considers how the terminal categories could be triaged to initially focus on terminal categories which were either data poor or contained members that represented large exposure sources.

#### Constraining the landscape to the TSCA active inventory

##### TSCA inventory

Of the substances in the PFAS Landscape, only 617 substances were identified to be on the TSCA inventory, of which 293 were 'active' and the remaining 324 'inactive'. Active and inactive refers to the EPA's designation of whether a substance is active in US commerce based on the rule requiring industry to report chemicals manufactured or imported or processed in the US over a 10 year period ending 21st June 2016. Note: There were a further 41 degradation products that matched a TSCA substance i.e. a degradant of TSCA substance matched another TSCA substance. @fig-barplot-tsca shows a bar chart of the membership of the terminal categories and how that differs when considering TSCA inventory status (overall or by active TSCA only).

![Bar chart showing membership of terminal categories and how that differs when constrained by TSCA inventory or TSCA active inventory.](FigureS3_261123.png){#fig-barplot-tsca}

The largest membership when constrained by presence on the TSCA inventory still reflects the "Other aliphatics, lt7" and "Other aliphatics, gte7" categories. Across the terminal categories, 79% of the categories (71 out of the 90 categories) contain members on the TSCA inventory. If only categories containing substances that are on the TSCA active inventory are considered, then the number of terminal categories decreases to 57, i.e., 63% coverage. The majority of the categories where there are no examples on the TSCA inventory are relatively small in size with fewer than 40 members. There were a couple of "Side-chain aromatics" categories which were larger with members between 74-83 as well as the two of the "Unclassified" categories with 61-123 members.

##### Selection of representative substances in the constrained TSCA active inventory {#sec-maxmin-tsca}

Centroids were computed for the 57 terminal categories containing substances that were on the active TSCA inventory. For 16 of these terminal categories, membership exceeded 5, which permitted the MaxMinPicker approach to be applied to identified further analogues. An additional 64 analogues were selected from this constrained landscape. @fig-venn shows the overlap in substances (centroids and diverse) across the unconstrained and the TSCA active constrained landscapes. The minimal overlap between the sets highlights the limitations of using a constrained landscape, i.e., one which does not represent the breadth of the PFAS chemistry. However, the substances on the TSCA active inventory represent those substances that are currently in commerce in the US and potentially represent the largest exposure source. It is worth noting that the exact overalp in the venn diagram may not reflect the overlap in structurally similar substances.

![Venn diagram showing the overlap in substances based on whether they were identified as additional diverse picks or centroids in the unconstrained PFAS landscape and that constrained by the TSCA active inventory.](Figure7_071123.png){#fig-venn}

An evaluation of the structural diversity captured using the centroids and additional MaxMin substances relative to the number of substances that would need to be selected to attain 80% structural diversity coverage was also undertaken in the same manner as had been performed for the full landscape. For the 14 of the 16 categories where the MaxMin approach had been applied, the diverse picks originally selected captured more than 50% of the structural diversity as shown in @tbl-tsca-maxmin. This is not so surprising given the TSCA active set substantially limited the terminal category size and in turn their diversity.

: Terminal categories from the constrained TSCA active landscape where the MaxMin approach had been applied. Terminal categories for which 3 representative substance selections capture more than 50% of the structural diversity {#tbl-tsca-maxmin}

Notes: Number of chemicals for 80% structural diversity represents the number of diverse selections to capture 80% of the structural diversity, Cumulative % of Structural Diversity reflects the structural diversity captured by the diverse selections already made and Terminal Category size reflects the size of the terminal category if constrained by the availability of TSCA active substances.

For the largest terminal category, "Other aliphatics, lt7, 3.0, 4.0", 3 diverse substance selections only captured 21% of the structural diversity. In order to capture 80% of the structural diversity for this terminal category, 17 substances would need to be selected for additional data collection. The number of substances to select from each terminal category to capture 80% of the structural diversity varied from 2 to 17 with the median number being 4. Across the entire TSCA active space, considering the 16 categories where a MaxMin approach could be applied -- 76 substances would need to be selected capture an 80% structural diversity. That it is to say, in order to capture a minimum of 80% structural diversity across all the TSCA active categories, at least 117 substances (centroids + MaxMin) would be ideally selected for data collection. @fig-structdiv-tsca summarizes the structural diversity attained across all TSCA Active terminal categories.

#### Proof of Concept Workflow: Identifying potential candidates for data collection

The availability of toxicity data across different study types and the presence of substances within different monitoring lists was arrayed across the terminal categories. All oral and inhalation studies from ToxValDB 9.4 were first retrieved as described in @sec-rax. There were 92 substances with data for one or more of the study types which were then matched on the basis of DTXSID with substances in the PFAS landscape. The resulting table was then transformed to produce a table where columns represented different study types, rows were substances and cells were labelled 1 if data for a specific study type existed for a specific substance and 0 if no data existed. The qualitative lists reflecting various priorities, environmental detection/discharged, and availability of analytical methods etc. as described in @sec-lists were compiled together and transformed into a table where rows represented substances, columns represented the different list sources and cells were populated with a 1 or 0 to denote presence or absence on a specific list. There were 348 unique substances found across the different environmental monitoring and discharge lists which were then matched with substances in the PFAS landscape. CDR status tags and Pubmed count tags were then added to the PFAS landscape. Columns representing the toxicity study types and various lists were grouped by terminal category to produce a new table which reflected presence or absence of information (denoted by 1 or 0) on a per terminal category. Study quality was not considered - only the availability of publicly available toxicity data. The set of terminal categories were filtered to retain only those terminal categories which contained members on the TSCA active inventory (57 terminal categories). @fig-hm-tscaact provides a perspective of this information, namely the toxicity data sparsity across the categories that fall within the scope of the TSCA active inventory as well as different environmental monitoring efforts or discussed in the literature. The PFAAs categories and their subcategorizations show up with data entries which is largely unsurprisingly, given the extent to which PFOA and PFOS have been studied.

Each of the earlier sections in of themselves highlight different lines of evidence that can inform the identification of potential candidates for data collection. Here, an attempt was made to demonstrate how these steps can be integrated together to triage terminal categories and their potential candidates for subsequent tiered data collection efforts (@fig-test-cand). Step 1 is to consider a given terminal category and determine whether it meets the condition of being a 'data poor category'. Data-poor in this context was to consider whether this was a category that did not contain any members for which repeated dose toxicity data existed (by the oral or inhalation route and with a reported NOAEL, LOAEL, LOEL, NOEL, NEL or LEL value). There were 58 terminal categories out of the 90 total number of categories that met this condition.

The next step was to focus on terminal categories that overlapped with those which contained substances that were on the TSCA inventory.

![Workflow to highlight the main steps involved in prioritizing potential candidate selection for data collection for a given terminal category.](Figure15_PFAS.drawio.png){#fig-test-cand}

There were 71 terminal categories that contained substances that were on the TSCA inventory of which 57 terminal categories contained substances that were on the TSCA active inventory. Of the TSCA categories, 39 also satisfied the condition of being a 'data poor' category. In contrast, 25 of the TSCA active categories were 'data poor'. The following step was to consider terminal categories that contained substances that were on different environmental monitoring lists. There were 42 terminal categories that contained substances that were on one or more monitoring lists or 68 if Pubmed article availability was taken into account. Of these 44 terminal categories, 16 were also overlapping with data poor TSCA categories or 14 of the data poor TSCA active categories. The 14 terminal categories included "Other aliphatics, gte7, 1.0, nan", "Other aliphatics, lt7, 1.0, 2.0", "PFAS derivatives, lt7, 1.0, nan", "PFAS derivatives, lt7, 4.0, 2.0", "Side-chain aromatics, gte7, 1.0, 2.0" and "Unclassified, lt7, 2.0, 1.0".

For a category that satisfied all these conditions, the next step would be identify the representative substances characterizing the category (namely the centroid and MaxMin substances and check whether any were on the TSCA inventory). If none of these were on the inventory, then the next step would be to check whether the next closest match to the centroid was on the inventory. If not, the next steps would be to identify the centroid and MaxMin substances from either the TSCA constrained landscape or the TSCA active constrained landscape for that terminal category. @fig-test-cand summarizes these steps in a conceptual workflow.

For illustrative purposes, terminal category "PFAA precursors, gte7, nan, nan" was identified that met the conditions of being a data poor category, containing members on the TSCA active inventory and containing members on various environmental monitoring lists, discharge and TRI lists. This terminal category comprises 57 members. The centroid, DTXSID5059828 \[CASRN 335-58-0\] was on the TSCA inventory. Alternatively, the TSCA active centroid DTXSID0060147 \[CASRN 507-63-1\] could be selected. @fig-case-study shows a t-SNE project with the centroid, MaxMin and TSCA centroid substances shown for illustrative purposes to highlight their relative positions in the structural space captured within the terminal category.

![t-SNE projection of terminal category "PFAA precursors, gte7, nan, nan" with its (TSCA active) centroid and MaxMin substances shown.](Figure15_case_study_091123.png){#fig-case-study fig-pos="H"}

## Conclusions

EPA was directed by Congress to develop a process for prioritizing which PFAS or classes of PFAS should be subject to additional research efforts based on potential for human exposure to, toxicity of, and other available information. Herein, we describe an approach to create a relevant PFAS Landscape using the TSCA SNUR rule definition to continue the efforts initiated in the National PFAS Testing Strategy. 

A landscape of 12,456 PFAS substances was first developed based on the structural definition outlined in the TSCA SNUR rule. The landscape was then augmented with 2959 simulated degradation products of PFAS substances on the TSCA inventory using the Catalogic expert system. Adding simulated degradates was intended to enrich the landscape by substances that might be expected to be found in the environment from existing substances in commerce. The simulated degradation products were derived from an expert system which includes training set substances that are PFAS; however a full characterization of the model relative to the PFAS landscape was not feasible as some of the training set was proprietary in nature. For the portion of training set substances that could be evaluated -- there was a minimal overlap in datasets as shown in @fig-miti. The robustness of the simulated degradation products is a limitation in the approach and requires additional work but a pragmatic one given the absence of data to refine and improve the model further.

The 15,415 substances in the PFAS landscape were grouped into 90 terminal structural categories based on a stepwise process that combined OECD functional categories, chain length and structural similarity. Some of the terminal categories were very large and structurally diverse whilst others showed much greater structural similarity highlighting both the complexity of the PFAS structural landscape and local areas of homogeneity.

A method was developed to select the most representative substance (centroid) and other substances (MaxMin) to capture the structural diversity of each terminal category to guide data collection efforts. A substantial number of representative and diverse substances (~5000) would be required to capture 80% percentage of structural diversity in the terminal categories for the unconstrained landscape. Significantly fewer representative and diverse substances (117) would be required to capture 80% percentage of structural diversity in the terminal categories for the TSCA constrained landscape. The difference in utilizing the unconstrained and TSCA constrained landscape highlights the challenges in data collection to address future and theoretical data gaps versus those data gaps that exist among substances known to be in commerce.

Publicly available *in vivo* data across the terminal categories was used to evaluate whether read-across could be potentially viable based on the variation of the *in vivo* data itself. A 10th percentile of the minimum POD values for a given substance was calculated to derive a single value per substance. Not all terminal categories were associated with toxicity data but for those categories, the following insights were noted; substances with lower carbon chain length within a category tended to exhibit lower toxicities (i.e., higher PODs), but the spread of PODs within a category could be large particularly for diverse categories based on carbon chain length, spanning 2 orders of magnitude or more. In addition to the shift in potency between terminal categories containing longer vs short chain lengths, there was also a shift between terminal categories with different functional groups e.g. Non-PFAA perfluoroalkyls tended to be less potent vs. PFAAs.
The variability of *in vivo* PODs from traditional toxicity tests within some of the terminal categories suggests that structural considerations may not be sufficient for performing read across without additional data collection.
Information from NAMs were layered on the terminal categories to help identify potentially distinct mechanistic and TK-related subgroups, refine terminal categories, and inform data collection efforts.
  
Information from environmental measurements and release, traditional toxicity data, and chemical properties (physical state and physicochemical properties) were also layered on the terminal categories to help identify priorities for further data collection efforts.

The methods developed for categorizing the PFAS landscape, selecting representative substances, refining categories based on mechanistic and TK information, and prioritizing categories for data collection provide a robust foundation for EPA to address the significant environmental and human health challenges posed by this class of substances.

The methods and associated categories are flexible in accommodating additional data as it is generated and may evolve as the scientific knowledge grows.

### Evaluating the feasibility of subdividing the primary categories {#sec-supp}

Corina Symphony on the command line (licensed from Molecular Networks GmBH and Altamira LLC) was used to compute the 129 PFAS ToxPrints [@richard_new_2023]. The Fisher's exact test was used to compute an odds ratio and associated p value for each PFAS ToxPrint relative to the OECD primary category designation. This was comparable with the methodology discussed in Wang et al. [@wang_high-throughput_2019]. A PFAS ToxPrint was considered enriched if it had an odds ratio greater than or equal to 3, a one-sided Fishers exact p-value less than 0.05 (probability value of the odds ratio being greater than 1) and the number of True Positives (TP) was determined to be greater than or equal to 3. For the "Unclassified" primary category, the top 2 enriched ToxPrints were PFAS chain features: FT_n3_N, FT_n1_OP both of which represent fluorotelomer chains with either 3 or 1 CH2 units and a nitrogen or organophosphorus terminus. On the otherhand, the "Other aliphatics" had heteroatoms, nitrile and primary amines as enriched functional groups. The intention was to explore whether certain types of features were specifically enriched in these broad primary categories to consider splitting them apart to reduce the starting membership. The full set of enrichments for all primary categories are provided as a separate data file. {{< pagebreak >}}
